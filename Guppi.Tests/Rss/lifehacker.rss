      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/current-status-of-the-tiktok-ban" target="_blank">TikTokers may have returned to their platform of choice</a>, but with the U.S. ban still on the books, they are facing an existential threat. Meanwhile, Instagram Reels users are encountering a problem of the platform's own making: Meta, in all its wisdom, is making it easier than ever for users to see who liked a particular reel. That means two things, of course: It's easier than ever to see which videos your friends have liked, but it's also easier than ever for your friends to see which videos <em>you </em>have liked. </p><p>Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DE7eV_zxKbx/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">announced the changes in a post on Friday</a>. Here's what's new: When you launch Reels on Instagram, you may now see a bar appear in the top right corner of the screen where you'll find profile pictures of friends that have liked a particular reel. Tap this bar, and you'll be taken to another video feed, dubbed "With friends." This feed exclusively features reels that your friends have liked. In my experience, most videos  in the feed have a like from exactly one friend, but now and again I'll see reels liked by multiple friends. </p><p>Whether the video has one like or three, you can tap on any user's profile picture to confirm, yes, they did like this reel, and to reply to them if you wish. There is also a bar on the bottom of the page that lets you reply to that user's like, or simply react with a laughing, crying, or "in love" emoji.</p><p>When you do reply to a like, it'll send your friend a DM. Here, they'll see a thumbnail of the video in question, with your message or emoji reaction below it. Above it, they'll see "Replied to your like," so they'll know this was a direct reply to their like, rather than you sharing a video <em>you </em>liked with them.</p><h2 id="instagram-has-already-been-showing-likes-for-a-while">Instagram has already been showing likes for a while</h2><p>Some of this experience isn't new. Anyone who has spent time scrolling on Reels knows that Instagram will frequently show you when one or more of your friends has liked a reel you're watching. However, this change puts those likes on display in a way they weren't before: Previously, running into friends' likes was a much more casual and passive process. Now, you can knowingly scroll through videos your friends liked, dramatically increasing the number of liked videos you'll encounter.</p><p>I suppose there's an argument that this change makes it easier to find content you might enjoy, since you presumably share some interests with your Instagram friends. However, I also another side of the argument&mdash;that making likes much more visible will encourage people to <em>stop</em> liking reels. Instagram Reels is a blackhole of content, and your fine-tuned algorithm probably shows you at least some videos <em>you </em>find interesting or funny, but you know other people won't. Or maybe you'd rather others not know you find them interesting or funny. There's a lot of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-brain-rot" target="_blank">brain rot humor</a> floating around out there (among other things), and I'd wager many wouldn't want to offer a glowing endorsement of each bizarre video that gets a reaction out of them.</p><h2 id="can-you-stop-friends-from-seeing-reels-you-liked-on-instagram">Can you stop friends from seeing reels you liked on Instagram? </h2><p>If this change has you feeling anxious, bad news: This time, there doesn't appear to be a way to disable the feature. Instagram does let you hide likes on posts and reels from view, but the app doesn't offer an option to stop others from seeing which reels you've liked. For now, if you like a video, you should assume it's possible your friends will know about it at some point while scrolling through the app.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Bravia X93L is a Mini LED-backlit Google Smart TV (you can use Apple AirPlay and Google Cast), meaning you won't get the contrast of an OLED but you'll have more brightness&mdash;1,383 nits. It is a 4K TV with a 3,840 by 2,160 resolution, Dolby Vision and HDR-10, four HDMI ports (two of which are 2.1 ports with 120Hz, but one of those is the E-ARC connection for audio), a contrast ratio of 1,383,000:1, a 120 Hz refresh rate, 9.8 ms input lag in game mode (not the best, but still good), and variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming&mdash;but no AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync.</p><p>People looking for a TV for their home theater system will appreciate its design to easily fit a soundbar on the front or below the TV, with adjustable legs for width and height. It also handles reflection very well, in part due to its brightness. If you're not looking to get a soundbar or surround sound, the audio is much better than its competitors (although like all TVs, the bass will always be lacking). </p><p>You can read more about this TV in <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/sony-bravia-75-inch-class-x93l-xr-75x93l" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag's "excellent" review</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Is It Ever a Good Idea to Opt for an Adjustable Rate Mortgage?</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JJ4ZN9E43WP0ZD9CWWXS76QC</guid>

      <description>You could save on interest, but it needs to be a calculated risk.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ4ZN9E43WP0ZD9CWWXS76QC/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prospective homeowners face a crucial decision when <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/it-may-be-time-to-refinance-mortgage" target="_blank">choosing between</a> fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). While ARMs have a controversial reputation following the 2008 housing crisis, financial experts suggest there are specific scenarios where they might be the right choice for certain borrowers. Here's what you should know about how adjustable-rate mortgages work, and when they might be the right call for you.</p><h2 id="when-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-could-make-sense">When an adjustable rate mortgage could make sense</h2><p>The primary appeal of ARMs lies in their lower initial interest rates compared to fixed-rate mortgages. These introductory rates typically last between three and 10 years, offering significant savings during the early years of homeownership. Chad Gammon, CFP and owner of <a href="https://customfitfinancial.com/about-us" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Custom Fit Financial</a>, explains that this lower initial rate can be particularly advantageous for homeowners who anticipate either income growth or falling interest rates during the loan period.  </p><p>However, Gammon emphasizes the importance of understanding the risks: "Once that introductory interest rate period ends, the rate could adjust upwards." A good example would be ARMs that were taken out pre-2020. He stresses that ARMs are more complex financial instruments, making it crucial for borrowers to fully comprehend the implications of extending beyond the fixed-rate period.</p><h3>Short-term homeownership</h3><p>For those not planning to put down long-term roots, ARMs can offer substantial benefits. Doug Carey, CFA and founder of <a href="https://www.mywealthtrace.com/financial-coach" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">WealthTrace</a>, points out that many homeowners stay in their properties for less than seven years. "If the plan is to sell the home before the rate adjusts," Carey explains, "the lower initial rate gives them a financial benefit." This strategy allows homeowners to capitalize on lower rates during their planned stay while avoiding potential rate increases down the line.</p><h3>Affordability in high-cost markets</h3><p>In expensive housing markets, ARMs can make homeownership more accessible. The lower initial payments can help buyers qualify for homes that might otherwise be out of reach with a traditional fixed-rate mortgage. While this approach carries future rate adjustment risks, it can be a calculated risk for those expecting income growth or planning to refinance later.</p><h3>Strategic refinancing opportunities</h3><p>Many ARM borrowers <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/it-may-be-time-to-refinance-mortgage" target="_blank">plan to refinance</a> before their adjustable period begins. Carey highlights this as a potential money-saving strategy: "Take advantage of low rates during the initial period, then refinance at a favorable time to either lock in a lower fixed rate or continue with another ARM." This approach requires careful timing and market awareness but can result in significant long-term savings.</p><h2 id="how-to-decide-if-an-arm-is-the-right-call-for-you">How to decide if an ARM is the right call for you</h2><p>Andre Small, Founder &amp; Financial Planner at <a href="https://www.asmallinvestment.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">A Small Investment, LLC</a>, shares a practical example of when ARMs make sense. He describes working with a client whose career required frequent relocation, but who still wanted to build real estate equity. In this case, an ARM provided the flexibility to "pay down debts now, as well as maintain manageable debt levels for a predetermined time frame."</p><p>When considering an ARM, potential borrowers should evaluate several factors:</p><ul><li><p>Expected length of homeownership</p></li><li><p>Career trajectory and potential income growth</p></li><li><p>Current market conditions and rate trends</p></li><li><p>Personal risk tolerance</p></li><li><p>Long-term financial goals</p></li></ul><p>While ARMs can offer significant advantages in certain circumstances, they require careful consideration of the risks and a clear understanding of the loan terms.</p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>Adjustable-rate mortgages can be a viable option for some borrowers, but the key lies in having a clear exit strategy. If you can take advantage of the lower rates to make more payments to principal, ARMs can be a savvy move. But if you<em> need</em> an ARM to afford a house, you are taking on a significant risk. As with any major financial decision, consulting with financial professionals who can evaluate your specific situation is crucial before committing to an ARM.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bluesky and X Just Launched TikTok-Style Video Feeds</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JJ59ES3PCEMQWQ9KCSC5R391</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Both X and Bluesky have released new video feeds to take on TikTok, but which is better?</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ59ES3PCEMQWQ9KCSC5R391/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, that was a big weekend, but <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/current-status-of-the-tiktok-ban" target="_blank"><u>TikTok is back</u></a>, right? Well, not so fast. The law banning the popular short form video app from app stores has still gone into effect, new users still can&rsquo;t download it, and Trump&rsquo;s executive order postponing enforcement of the ban only gives Bytedance 75 days to come up with a solution. On that note, both X and Bluesky have thrown their hats into the ring as potential TikTok replacements.</p><p>Technically, both sites already supported video, and X even already had the ability to swipe from one video to the next. What&rsquo;s new, aside from Bluesky also gaining swipeable videos, is the new video feeds.</p><h2 id="blueskys-new-video-feed">Bluesky's new video feed</h2><p>Bluesky has gained the most features, so let&rsquo;s start there. Previously, videos on Bluesky used to work much like they did on the Twitter of old, where they could be attached to posts, but didn&rsquo;t have a browsing interface of their own. Now, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/post/3lg5g64vptc23" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>users can create their own video feeds</u></a>, which will be populated by swipeable videos related to that feed&rsquo;s particular subject.</p><p>It works much like text post feeds, where you can pin a particular timeline to your main Bluesky page, either generated by the site itself or by users, and that timeline will be populated by relevant posts. But where text feeds, like the default &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; and &ldquo;Following&rdquo; timelines, will show a more traditional scrolling webpage format, video feeds display more like&hellip;well, TikTok. Simply pick a video to start with from a list of recent options, then swipe to browse like you&rsquo;ve probably gotten used to on the other app.</p><p>To start, you can access a trending videos feed right from the search bar (which you can disable entirely under <strong>Settings &gt; Content &amp; Media</strong>, if you&rsquo;re not into short form videos), but users have already been hard at work creating pin-worthy curated feeds like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:geoqe3qls5mwezckxxsewys2/feed/bookskyvids" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>#BookSky Vids</u></a> that are specific to certain topics.</p><p>This should give Bluesky a unique approach compared to TikTok, where what users see is by-and-large at the mercy of the algorithm (excepting the &ldquo;Following&rdquo; and &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; tabs). Instead, these custom feeds will only show videos from specific accounts, handpicked by the creators of said feeds.</p><h2 id="xs-new-video-tab">X's new video tab</h2><p>For a while now, X&rsquo;s videos have already worked much like TikTok&rsquo;s, but now they&rsquo;re much more prominent. Now, at the bottom of X&rsquo;s mobile app, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://x.com/XBusiness/status/1881169825214664932" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>small circular play button</u></a> that immediately starts playing a TikTok-like &ldquo;personalized feed of recommended videos.&rdquo; You can like, repost, comment on, and share these videos, but for now, there&rsquo;s no way to access a feed that only shows videos from creators you follow, and little indication as to how X&rsquo;s algorithm works. It truly is Elon roulette over there, but for what it&rsquo;s worth, the feed does seem to take some inspiration from the rest of your X activity. Mine started with innocuous pet videos before quickly veering into absurd Godzilla and Vtuber content, which I don&rsquo;t think most people would like as much as me.</p><p>Still, the feed definitely has room to grow. For instance, the only way to access your watch history is to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/download-your-tweets-before-quitting-twitter-1849778871" target="_blank"><u>download an archive of your X data</u></a>.</p><h2 id="are-bluesky-and-x-ready-to-take-on-tiktok">Are Bluesky and X ready to take on TikTok?</h2><p>With TikTok back up for now, assuming you already had it downloaded, it&rsquo;ll probably be a while before either replacement gets a chance to pose a serious threat to it, especially with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-download-instagram-reels" target="_blank"><u>Instagram still trying to make Reels happen</u></a>. But both are clearly still in an early stage regardless, so perhaps they could do with the time to bake. For instance, neither works quite right on desktop at the moment, with Bluesky just showing your video feeds like a traditional timeline of text posts with videos attached, while X isn&rsquo;t showing its new video tab on desktop at all. However, Bluesky might have an edge here, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3lg5g65ecms23" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>indie developers</u></a> are already at work making their own TikTok alternatives using the AT Protocol technology that powers Bluesky.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tcl-2024-tvs-are-here" target="_blank">Last year's TCL TV lineup</a> was released in May. The QM7 is a Mini-LED TV, which is the most premium technology that TCL offers. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/comparisons/oled-vs-qled-whats-the-difference" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Mini-LED QLED is supposed to be the closest you can get to OLED</a> visuals without actually being an OLED. This QM7 comes with over 1,500 local dimming zones, creating a deeper local dimming effect for better contrast. An advantage QLED Mini-LED has over QLED (aside from being cheaper) is it can get much brighter, with the QM7 reaching 2,400 nits at its peak.</p><p>Casual gamers will enjoy the option to double the 120 frames per second to 240 by cutting the 4K resolution in half, according to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/tcl-qm7-class-55-inch-tv-55qm751g" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag's "excellent" review</a>. You'll also get the usual HDR modes (Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG), IMAX Enhanced Certification, and built-in Onkyo 2.1 speakers with a built-in subwoofer.</p><p>Since it is a Google smart TV, it allows you to use hands-free Google Assistant voice controls, as well as Apple AirPlay and Google Cast. You get four HDMI ports, a 120Hz, two 144Hz, and one eARC. The eARC doesn't take one of the high-end ports, so you can hook up a soundbar and still use three other ports for gaming or a PC.</p><p>The stand and materials are where TCL cut costs for this TV, with a flimsy stand and a cheaper material for the build. But if you're mounting the TV, I'd take that if it means better specs in the visual department. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are plenty or reasons to be anxious and depressed about the world in 2025. And while parasocial relationships with your podcast friends are no substitute for therapy, a thoughtful, informative, empathetic podcast can be a useful addition to  your mental health toolbox.</p><p>Unfortunately, not all of these shows are helpful (or even worthwhile), and wading through a sea of them is probably not something you feel like doing when you're already stressed or sad. Thankfully, I've done that hard work for you: Here are eight shows that don't just spew generic tips and hollow affirmations, but actually use thoughtful conversations, untraditional storytelling, and specific structures that can help you through a rough spot. (They've certainly helped me&mdash;the fifth one on the list legitimately changed my life.) </p><hr><h2 id="basket-case"><em>Basket Case</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><a href="https://episodes.fm/1768939934" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><strong><em><u>Basket Case</u></em></strong></a> is a mental health podcast unlike any mental health podcast I&rsquo;ve listened to before. It&rsquo;s not offering hacks or tips, but considering the mental health industry as a whole, using intimate narrative storytelling to reveal how it systematically keeps us sick. It's more about the forces that contribute to mental illness than it is about mental health, but invaluable all the same. Host NK ushers us through different mental health issues, from perfectionism, to depression, to anxiety, in a way that makes them feel visceral and immediate. This is accomplished partially through an amazing soundscape, which NK uses to recreate other ways of experiencing the world.</p><hr><h2 id="the-blindboy-podcast"><em>The Blindboy Podcast</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>On every episode of <a href="https://episodes.fm/1407451189" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><strong><em><u>How To Fail</u></em></strong></a>, journalist Elizabeth Day asks her guest to take us through three failures they've experienced, reframing them as events that helped them be better people or live better lives (eventually, at least). Elizabeth  creates a magical chemistry with all of her guests, which have included the likes of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mo Gawdat, and Brene Brown. The focus isn&rsquo;t hacks or tips, but unpacking the mistakes and regrets that these people have been able to overcome, and how. You might not finish an episode feeling grateful for your latest screwup or setback, but hopefully it won't feel quite as dire either.</p><hr><h2 id="the-one-you-feed"><em>The One You Feed</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

The show covers a wide range of topics, and will help you realize not only that you don't have to feel so alone in your problems, but that so many others are facing different issues that probably have them feeling equally isolated. GIlmartin&rsquo;s secret ingredient is humor, but he doesn&rsquo;t skirt around the tough stuff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>These earbuds (rated "Excellent" by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/jabra-elite-10" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag</a>) have a semi-open fit that is said to offer more comfort than traditional in-ear models without fully embracing the "roomy" feel of open earbuds. Plus, they come with four pairs of oval silicone eartips in small, medium, large, and extra-large options, so finding a snug fit shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</p><p>That said, the on-ear controls of the ear pieces are reportedly a mixed bag&mdash;great for avoiding accidental touches, but prone to getting triggered while adjusting them in your ears. You can tweak these controls in the Jabra Sound+ app. The app is also where you&rsquo;ll find a five-band equalizer, presets like Bass Boost, and a &ldquo;Soundscapes&rdquo; section with relaxing white noise and ocean waves. On the sound front, with 10mm dynamic drivers delivering a 20Hz&ndash;20kHz frequency range, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXR7D?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Elite%2010s&amp;short_url=QxXR7D&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Elite 10s</a> reportedly bring deep, punchy bass without overwhelming the mids and highs, making the audio feel exciting (though purists may find the bass a bit too forward). As for ANC, these earbuds offer excellent noise cancellation, cutting down powerful, low-frequency rumbles to near-silence and handling highs and mids in noisy environments like a pro, notes this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/jabra-elite-10" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag review</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXR7D?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Elite%2010%27s&amp;short_url=QxXR7D&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Elite 10's</a> multipoint connectivity makes it easy to pair with two devices, while its Bluetooth 5.3 compatibility and Google Fast Pair features ensure a hassle-free setup. Additionally, durability is another win here. With their IP57 rating, dust won&rsquo;t bother them, and they can survive sweaty workouts, rain, or even a quick rinse. For comparison, top competitors from Apple, Bose, and Sony only manage an IPX4 rating, which is far less impressive. Battery life is decent, too&mdash;six hours with ANC on (or eight with it off), plus an extra 21 to 28 hours from the case, which also supports Qi wireless charging (adding some extra convenience). Of course, these numbers may vary slightly depending on your volume levels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>No one actually sorts real files anymore, so Finder is essential—but it could still be better.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finder is your pathway to all your Mac's files. Yes, you can (and should) use Spotlight to quickly find and open files. But when it comes to actually managing and working with files, folders, and documents, the Finder app is essential&mdash;especially since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">none of us know how to create a folder hierarchy anymore</a>.</p><p>It's good news, then, that Finder does a really good job of helping you organize files. But there are certain things about it that could be improved. What if every new Finder window didn&rsquo;t automatically default to the Recents folder? What if you could easily see the detailed path for a given folder? Or organize files using tags? Well, you can: here&rsquo;s how to customize what you see in the Finder app.</p><h2 id="how-to-customize-the-sidebar-in-finder">How to customize the sidebar in Finder</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The sidebar is where you&rsquo;ll probably start interacting with Finder, so you should take some time to add the things you want to see there and remove what&rsquo;s cluttering it up.</p><p>Go to <strong>Finder</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Sidebar</strong>. From here, select the sections that you want to show or hide. For example, you can remove the Tags section, limit the Locations items, and prune down the Favorites section.</p><p>After you've done that, navigate to some of your frequently used folders and drag them to the Favorites section so you&rsquo;ll always be able to access them easily.</p><h2 id="how-to-change-finders-default-folder">How to change Finder's default folder </h2><p>By default, Finder launches with the Recents folder ready to go.

<p>Every finder user should enable the path bar. It gives you a sense of where exactly you are in a file directory. Go to <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Show Path Bar</strong> to turn it on.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll now see the path for every folder at the bottom of the Finder window. You can click on any folder from the path to navigate to it. You can also quickly copy the full pathname by clicking on a folder from the path and choosing the &ldquo;<strong>Copy as Pathname</strong>&rdquo; option. </p><p>If you don&rsquo;t want to always see your file path, you can choose to display it selectively; just right-click on the file or folder name at the top of your Finder window to see a list of all the folders or files your current file/folder&nbsp;stems from. </p><h2 id="how-to-show-the-finder-status-bar">How to show the Finder status bar</h2><p>By default, the status bar in Finder only does two things: It shows you how many items there are in a folder (and how many are selected), as well as how much space is left on your Mac.

<p>If you're using a 13-inch MacBook Air, you might find it difficult to view a long list of file names. Try increasing Finder's font size. To do this, go to <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Show View Options</strong>, and from the &ldquo;<strong>Text Size</strong>&rdquo; option, bump the text size up to a reasonable number (16 is probably a good choice).</p><h2 id="open-new-finder-folders-in-windows-instead-of-tabs">Open new Finder folders in windows instead of tabs</h2><p>Finder now has tabs, just like Safari. Simply double-click a folder while holding the Command key to start using them. However, if you'd rather go back to using windows with this shortcut instead, that's still an option.</p><p>To revert back to the old behavior, go to <strong>Finder</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> and uncheck the &ldquo;<strong>Open folders in tabs instead of new windows</strong>&rdquo; option. </p><h2 id="change-folder-view-and-sorting">Change folder view and sorting</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Finder offers you powerful ways to customize how you view and sort items in your folders. First, the <strong>Views</strong>. Click on the Views icon in the top toolbar to choose between Icons, a List, Columns, and a Gallery.</p><p>Each view is useful depending on the folder's content. Icons are the default, but you can switch to the Gallery view to make it easier to view images in a larger preview size. The Columns view shows you a multi-pane structure, so you can keep digging deeper into your folder structure while still keeping an eye on higher-level folders. List is the most powerful view, and it's what I usually default to. It shows all files and folders sorted based on different metrics, like name, last time updated, or size. You can click on any of these properties to change the sorting, and all this metadata is always available right next to the file name, which is super handy.</p><p>You can also choose the <strong>Group</strong> icon from the toolbar to group files based on different criteria like name, application, tags, size, when the files were last updated, and more.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The only thing to note here as that all these view settings are on a per-folder basis, so you'll need to change the settings for each folder as you navigate through them. Though, once they are set, Finder will remember your settings going forward.</p><h2 id="show-hidden-files-on-mac">Show hidden files on Mac</h2><p>If you use hidden files often, or you need to see hidden files in the system or Library folder, you can quickly use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Command+Shift+.</strong> (period) to make them appear or disappear.</p><p>And if you're into keyboard shortcuts, try out<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/marta-macos-finder-alternative" target="_blank"> the Marta app</a>.

By default, it searches only the current folder that you're in, not your entire Mac.</p><p>Go to <strong>Finder &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced</strong>. In the "When performing a search" section, switch to the <strong>Search This Mac</strong> option. Or better yet, switch to <strong>Use the Previous Search Scope</strong> to make sure the Finder remembers whichever option you used last.</p><h2 id="dont-be-afraid-to-use-tags">Don't be afraid to use Tags</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Don't sleep on Finder Tags. They are just as useful as the tags in your reminders app. Right-click on any file or folder to assign a colored tag to it. If you click on the Tags button, you can also create a new custom tag, with a color of your choice. Tags that are in use will automatically show up in the Finder sidebar for quick access.</p><p>Tags are a great way to group similar files in one view, without moving them between folders. This way, you can collect all the files related to a project in one section, and then get rid of the tag when the work is done.</p><h2 id="customize-quick-actions">Customize Quick Actions</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Quick Actions is a relatively new addition to Finder, but already hosts one of the best new hidden features on the Mac. Right-click on an image, choose <strong>Convert Image</strong>, and you can convert a HEIC image to JPEG, or reduce an image's size with ease. But you can also click the Customize button to add more features to this menu. The best thing to add to Quick Actions, though, are Shortcuts. You can create shortcuts to resize images or move or manipulate files, helping automate your browsing process.</p><h2 id="improve-quick-look">Improve Quick Look</h2><p>Quick Look is one of my all-time favorite Finder features.

      <title>The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: What RedNote Is Like</title>

      <description>The ongoing TikTok drama is creating a massive cultural exchange program.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHV7N5P3QTVGTX3SBCQBHF0R/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young-person culture is in a state of upheaval this week. With social media platform TikTok going dark, then quickly coming back online, generations Z and Alpha have seen the forces at be closing and opening their main window on the world. </p><p>In other news, Elon Musk is still acting weird&mdash;and it's still funny to embarrass your mom at the store. </p><h2 id="whats-the-vibe-like-on-rednote">What's the vibe like on RedNote?</h2><p>Given the upheaval and uncertainty surrounding TikTok, many TikTokers have been fleeing to another Chinese app, Xiaohongshu (or RedNote), <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-happens-after-tiktok-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">since last week</a>. </p><p>So you don't have to, I made <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/678978ac000000000d00ae50?xsec_token=YBbOOW5IC9W7roUcYhlcfQkVXux_ePM3tp5isvOHFDIQY=&amp;xsec_source=app_share&amp;xhsshare=CopyLink&amp;appuid=678978ac000000000d00ae50&amp;apptime=1737143626&amp;share_id=7837d018cb1845839a208bbaced431f5" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">an account</a> and spent the last few days poking around the TikTok alternative&mdash;posting videos, puzzling over Mandarin, and making new friends&mdash;to get an idea of the vibe on RedNote. My verdict: The young people of America and China are in the midst of the largest cultural exchange program ever (that doesn't involve literal colonization) and it's beautiful. </p><p>The most notable difference I noticed between TikTok and RedNote is the level of engagement. With a minutes-old account, I posted a few short clips of my sister's dog and my niece and I high-fiving, and was rewarded with hundreds of views and likes, and a reasonable number of "follows." Most of the comments were in Mandarin, but an in-app translation showed they weren't people saying, "stay in your own lane, yankee." Instead, it was more like, "cute dog!" and "wow, that's cool!" It's a welcoming, curious place.</p><p>Exploring a bit further reveals a ton of popular posts where young people from China and the U.S. ask each other questions about their respective cultures; videos of TikTok refugees showing off their newly acquired Mandarin-speaking skills; RedNote readers welcoming their new American friendsl and, for some reason, many videos of Chinese people imitating Donald Trump. It's <em>way</em> more interesting than paging through TikTok. </p><p>While there are deeper questions about the implications of all this, for now, there's an overall "it's all love" vibe that's encouraging. I highly recommend checking out RedNote. </p><h2 id="elon-musks-fake-gaming-drama-continues">Elon Musk's fake gaming drama continues</h2><p>While legions of young people flock to social media platforms owned by Chinese billionaires, our favorite American billionaire social media owner, Elon Musk, continues to show his ass in hilarious ways. Musk, upset that <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-happens-after-tiktok-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">YouTuber Asmongold called him out publicly</a> for faking his gaming prowess, has fired back. Elon Musk could do literally <em>anything</em> with his time, but he's chosen to spend it flaming a gaming nerd from YouTube. He removed Asmondgold's verification on X, stopped following him, and lambasted him online. <a href="http://section.In" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">In</a> <a href="https://x.com/ScreamheartTV/status/1879700459423940824" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a comment on another gamer's account,</a> Musk, an adult, posted, "Asmon behaves like a maverick 'independent', but in reality has to ask his boss for permission before he can do anything. He is not his own man." And he posted <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2988916-elon-musk-fraud-gamer-controversy" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a screenshot of DMs between himself and Asmongold</a> to back up the assertion. </p><p>I find mucking about in internet drama to be depressing, but I will point out that Musk's evidence is that Asmondgold mentions his "editors." He seems to think that these editors are Asmond's bosses, but he seems to be referring to the <em>video</em> editors who cut his YouTube clips, not <em>editor</em>-editors that make editorial decisions. </p><p>I still can't believe Elon Musk is an actual person, not a character in a sketch on <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>. </p><h2 id="in-a-surprise-announcement-nintendo-reveals-the-switch-2">In a surprise announcement, Nintendo reveals the Switch 2 </h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>As we know from his <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-happens-after-tiktok-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">recent livestream</a>, Elon Musk only plays games on "max difficulty, on hardcore," so he's probably not interested in the upcoming Switch 2 release. People who like games that are fun, though, are psyched. Anticipation levels among the Nintendo faithful has been high. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/nintendo-just-surprised-announced-the-switch-2" target="_blank">Information has been leaking</a> for months. Nintendo was almost stealth in its rollout: The company just dropped a YouTube video and called it a day. There isn't all that much to say about the new console. It's a little bigger than the first Switch; it's going to be backwards compatible; it comes out in 2025. If you want to try out the Switch 2 yourself, Nintendo is rolling out a "give it a try" programs in <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/heres-when-you-can-try-the-switch-2-for-yourself" target="_blank">select cities starting in April</a>. </p><h2 id="ai-designed-gorilla-sofa-available-in-real-life">AI-designed Gorilla sofa available in real life</h2><p>Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/inspiringdesignsnet/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Inspiring Designs</a> specializes in posting AI-generated images of truly terrible-looking design ideas, like these: </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Rather than discussing black holes, Nolan turns the volume up high and uses his computer to say things like, "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEWImgssjjz/?hl=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">She drugs me to keep a vegetable!</a>" and "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DENokqvRU2h/?hl=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Mom, you were talking about how you wanted to go to a strip club after this</a>." Nolan also delights in calling his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAoBVYPR44m/?hl=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">brother a fat-ass</a>, which is also hilarious. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>38 of the Best Queer Movies of the Past 100 Years</title>

      <description>These ain't your bisexual grandma's queer movies. Except for the ones that are.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GJM09BGK6W9PTR187YGTD/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Sure, you could spend the next four years dissociating as we prepare for a rapid erosion of hard-won LGBTQ+ rights. It's not like media has been the best ally throughout the struggle for basic acceptance anyway, and given that one of the incoming administration's first executive orders involves pretending that trans people aren't real (an assertion that defies biology, human history, and the lived experiences of millions of people, the future isn't boding well. </p><p>Yet while movies and the media can't save us, they can represent us. Movies can move the needle on mainstream acceptance (even if only in small ways), and spunky independent films can make us feel seen, offer encouragement, or get us mad enough to fight back. So maybe squeeze in a movie when you're not throwing bricks or glowering at the wall. Below, I&rsquo;ve highlighted 30 standouts from the past century, not so much to prove that every one of them broke new ground upon release (though many did), but to illustrate that queer talent has been on display in front of and behind the camera since the medium&rsquo;s earliest days.</p><p>(Rather than list <em>every</em> great movie with LGBTQ+ themes and characters, I&rsquo;ve tried to throw in some lesser-appreciated movies that are every bit as good&mdash;or better&mdash;than more well-known favorites.)</p><hr><h2 id="michael-1926"><em>Michael </em>(1926)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-roTvXHwWR7Q"></div>
</div>


<p>Carl Theodor Dreyer, best known for his 1928 masterpiece <em>The Passion of Joan of Arc</em>, brought a similar visual inventiveness to his earlier <em>Michael</em>, the story of a love triangle between a sculptor, his model (the title&rsquo;s Michael), and the sculptor&rsquo;s long-suffering friend. It&rsquo;s a doomed romance, but not because of any moralizing about the M4M love. It&rsquo;s a story of not being able to see what&rsquo;s right in front of you. And, yes, I realize that Michael just misses the centenary mark based on its German release in late 1924, but its American release wasn't until two years later, so I'm allowing it. <strong>You can stream <em>Michael</em> on <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/michael" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The very first Best Picture Oscar-winner is the WWI-set story of a pair of rivals who become good friends. <em>Very</em> good friends, if you catch my meaning, though it's just ambiguous enough that it didn't raise suspicions at the time. Throughout the film, the two pilots are competitors for the affections of an ambulance driver played by Clara Bow, typically decked out in her intentionally masc uniform, complete with cropped hair and lace-up leather boots. The famous tracking shot across a number of tables in a bar includes a lesbian couple just on the verge of a kiss as the camera sweeps by, but it's the death scene (sorry about the 98-year-old spoiler) between our two pilots that really seals the deal: If their tender caresses and kiss can't quite be described as overtly gay, the scene is certainly queer in its portrayal of male affection. <strong>You can stream <em>Wings</em> on Tubi or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXem3?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=znXem3&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The story of troubled schoolgirl Manuela (Hertha Thiele) who quickly gets hot for teacher at her all-girls school, <em>M&auml;dchen in Uniform</em> arrived at a pivotal moment in German history: Paragraph 175, outlawing homosexuality, had been repealed a couple of years earlier, and what would later be seen as the &ldquo;decadent&rdquo; Weimar era was in full swing. With queer women behind the camera and plenty of lesbian longing, and snogging, onscreen, the movie was a hit in much of Europe, while lobbying by <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7429-the-femme-solidarity-and-queer-allyship-of-m-dchen-in-uniform" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">no less than Eleanor Roosevelt</a> ensured that American audiences got to see the film (a detail I adore). It&rsquo;s a beautifully realized film about romantic longing that never devolves into melodrama; it also invites us to imagine the kinds of female-centric movies we might have had if there had been more women behind the camera during the golden age of Hollywood. <strong>You can stream <em>M&auml;dchen in Uniform </em>on <a href="https://zdcs.link/nJmNq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Plex&amp;short_url=nJmNq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Plex</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>However we choose to define Greta Garbo&rsquo;s real-life gender and sexuality&mdash;some say bisexual is closest to the mark, others say lesbian; she referred to herself as male most of the time and signed letters as &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; so there are layers&mdash;there&rsquo;s no question her gender-fluid screen persona, in roles that were <em>at least</em> bisexual-coded, made her a huge box office draw in a very different era. Her, she plays the unconventional, bisexual Swedish Queen involved in not only affairs of state, but also romances with co-stars John Gilbert and Elizabeth Young. All that aside, it&rsquo;s a beautiful historic romance about a powerful, complicated woman with a killer (and often referenced) final shot. <strong>You can rent <em>Queen Christina</em> from Prime Video.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>While I&rsquo;m trying to avoid queer coding in favor of movies with aboveboard queer characters and content, doing that gets harder during Hollywood&rsquo;s so-called golden age, when the rules explicitly forbade any such thing. With <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em>, though, there&rsquo;s too much gay going on to ignore. The plot revolves around gloriously flamboyant Dr. Septimus Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), an mentor of Victor Frankenstein&rsquo;s from his school days who sweeps in on the eve of Victor&rsquo;s wedding night to drag him away (with only mild convincing required) so that the two can conduct some experiments to determine if they can make life together. With that plot, <a href="https://the-avocado.org/2021/10/18/lgbt-movies-gods-and-monsters-1998/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">and the queer rep in front of and behind the camera</a>, this one&rsquo;s  very much a gay fever dream. <strong>You can rent <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBpJWB?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aBpJWB&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Though Hitchcock&rsquo;s adaptation of the play of the same name scrubs  overt references to its lead characters&rsquo; sexuality (which wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed at the time), the director was never afraid to push homosexual subtext to the very edge, and a viewer would have to be fairly sheltered to see prissy, fastidious murderers Brandon and Phillip (John Dall and Farley Granger) as mere roommates. The limited setting and experimental filming style didn&rsquo;t entirely please Hitchcock, but the claustrophobic atmosphere and sharp dialogue rachet up the suspense nicely. You can stream Rope on The Criterion Channel or rent it from Prime Video. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Two prisoners are tormented by a voyeuristic prison guard in Jean Genet&rsquo;s short film, full of homoerotic imagery that might be less shocking in 2023, but no less effective. The two never touch, except in a fantasy sequence, but seeing the two men share a bit of smoke from a single cigarette remains one of cinema&rsquo;s hottest images. You might also find the movie under the title <em>Song of Love</em>. <strong>You can stream <em>Un chant d&rsquo;amour</em> on <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/song-love" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Unavailable for decades, <em>Olivia</em> is almost shockingly forthright: the nutshell premise involves an all-girls school divided into cliques whose loyalty is fought over by the lesbian couple who run things. The student-teacher angle is troubling to modern eyes, but this isn&rsquo;t a lascivious movie exactly, despite the setup. It&rsquo;s the title character&rsquo;s coming-of-age story, smart in telling a story about how we have to choose the person we want to be, even as we&rsquo;re constantly being pulled in different directions. <strong>You can stream Olivia on <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/movie/olivia-edwige-feuillere/17277890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Hoopla</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

    <div id="video-container-3nPIvXomwq4"></div>
</div>


<p>Dealing with the same questions of masculinity inherent in other movies of the era (think <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>), <em>Tea &amp; Sympathy</em> represents an awkward, fascinating look at 1950s ideas of queerness. Tom Robinson Lee (John Kerr) is the new kid at an all-boys prep school  bursting with gay subtext (consider the ways the other boys love to roughhouse and worship their coach&mdash;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/25-of-the-gayest-straight-movies-ever-made-1849582832" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="open in a new window">it&rsquo;s so straight that it circles around to being very, very gay</a>. Tom is a shy and fey reader, gay bashed by his more overtly butch classmates, who strikes up a friendship with the headmaster&rsquo;s wife that turns romantic. It&rsquo;s all fascinating, even if it doesn&rsquo;t stand up to strict analysis, and director Vincente Minelli certainly knows how to make a compelling movie. <strong>You can rent <em>Tea &amp; Sympathy</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXbN2?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=avXbN2&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>This whackadoo Southern Gothic Mystery (from a Tennessee Williams play) involves a young man, the son of Katherine Hepburn&rsquo;s memorably named Violet Venable, who dies under mysterious circumstances on a holiday in Spain. Though Violet had been happy to be his wingwoman in helping him meet other men for sexual encounters, she&rsquo;s less keen on the world finding out precisely how he died. She&rsquo;s perfectly happy to lobotomize one of her son&rsquo;s good friends just to make sure; it&rsquo;s a wild time, right up to the  memorably off the wall finale. <strong>You can stream <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em> on Tubi or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXm6G?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QqXm6G&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>When 17-year-old Jo (Rita Tushingham) becomes pregnant by a sailor (he&rsquo;s long gone by the time she realizes), she can&rsquo;t turn to her needy, alcoholic mother for comfort. Instead, she falls into the arms of Geof (the great Murray Melvin), a gay textile student and the most wholesome character in the entire movie. It was shocking at the time, not only for including a gay character but for its gritty realism, making it a brilliant taste of what was to come. <strong>You can stream <em>A Taste of Honey</em> on Max, The Criterion Channel, and Kanopy or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjvO4?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=zEjvO4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Not only does Dirk Bogarde (closeted at the time) play one of cinema&rsquo;s first bisexual characters, he&rsquo;s the hero of the story, and entirely sympathetic (if a <em>victim</em>, as the title suggests). Bogarde a successful London lawyer (sorry: <em>barrister</em>) who is being blackmailed for his occasional sexual encounters with a male friend. It&rsquo;s a landmark in its treatment of queer characters but, as importantly, it&rsquo;s a taut and compelling neo-noir, briskly directed by veteran Basil Dearden. <strong>You can stream <em>Victim</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aewl36?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=aewl36&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> and The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPpXOO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QPpXOO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Long hard to find, but recently restored by Kino Lorber, documentary <em>The Queen </em>follows the contestants of a New York City drag pageant overseen by queen, activist, and trans icon Flawless Sabrina. It's a loose and joyful portrait of a distinct time in queer history, and includes appearances by luminaries of the era, including Andy Warhol, Edie Sedgewick, and designer Dorian Corey. <strong>You can stream <em>The Queen</em> on Kanopy and Kino Film or rent it from Prime Video.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>At the peak of Japan&rsquo;s New Wave, writer/director Toshio Matsumoto created this classic that blends ultra-realism with hauntingly beautiful, occasionally psychedelic imagery. The plot takes inspiration from, and flips, the story of <em>Oedipus Rex</em>, seamlessly blending the mythic with the mundane in following Eddie (Shinnosuke Ikehata) and other transgender women in the swinging Tokyo of the 1960s. <strong>You can stream <em>Funeral Parade of Roses</em> on<a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/funeral-parade-roses" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"> Kanopy</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>William Friedkin (<em>The French Connection</em>, <em>The Exorcist</em>) directs the film adaptation of the controversial off-Broadway play&mdash;controversial for the fact that every character is gay or bisexual, and controversial among queer audiences for frequently portraying its characters as self-hating and self-pitying. It&rsquo;s not exactly an uplifting portrait of being a gay man in America, but it reflects something real, if not always pretty. The performances are nearly uniformly great, and if  it plays as a pre-liberation period piece, there are plenty of other aspects that  still feel sadly relevant. (The play is still staged, and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81000365" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix did a new version</a> just a couple of years ago). <strong>You can rent T<em>he Boys in the Band</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2oNY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aX2oNY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A low-budget melodrama released in the wake of <em>The Boys in the Band</em>, <em>Some of My Best Friends Are...</em> follows the messy, boozy meanderings of the clientele of a New York gay bar over an evening. While a little excessively dramatic (and full of tiresomely self-pitying characters), it's less stagey than <em>Boys</em>, and more diverse, as well, at least in terms of the queer spectrum. We encounter gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters over the course of the night, and a straight chaser played by none other than Rue McClanahan. The eclectic cast is a big part of the appeal: McClahanan's is a major role alongside that of comedienne and author Fannie Flagg (best known for her <em>Match Game </em>appearances in the '70s and her novel <em>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe</em>, which she adapted into the successful '90s film). Trans Andy Warhol muse Candy Darling is also here, along with several other faces you may recognize if you watched too much TV in the 1970s and '80s.  <strong>You can stream <em>Some of My Best Friends Are...</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbxo2r?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=MGM%2B&amp;short_url=Qbxo2r&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">MGM+</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Long before <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, a queer-themed film earned some major attention from the Oscars&mdash;four nominations for this John Schlesinger film, though it did much better at the BAFTAs, actually <em>winning</em> five awards, including Best Film. More noteworthy is that regardless of its dramatic, and even tragic developments, the movie doesn't ever suggest that queerness is at the root of the characters' problems. Murray Head plays a freewheeling bisexual artist pursuing simultaneous relationships with a gay doctor (played by Peter Finch) and a straight consultant (the great Glenda Jackson). It wasn't a big hit at the box office, but it was one of the biggest critical successes of the year. <strong>You can stream <em>Sunday Bloody Sunday</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2o5W?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aX2o5W&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong> </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>At the center of John Waters&rsquo; so-called Trash Trilogy came <em>Female Trouble</em>, starring Divine as juvenile delinquent Dawn Davenport, whose quest for cha-cha heels leads her down a path of filth and misery more than worthy of (and very much inspired by) Hollywood&rsquo;s great melodramas. <em>Pink Flamingoes</em> might get name-checked more often, but nothing in John Waters oeuvre can beat Dawn&rsquo;s Christmas morning freak-out. <em>Female Trouble</em> is the best and most cohesive film from the director&rsquo;s early, most wonderfully perverse era. <strong>You can stream <em>Female Trouble</em> on <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/female-trouble" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The Criterion Channel</a></strong><strong> or buy it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORyYB?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QORyYB&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Al Pacino and the late, great John Cazale (who was never in a bad movie) play Sonny and Sal, first-time bank robbers <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/how-the-bungled-brooklyn-bank-robbery-that-inspired-dog-day-afternoon-made-1-man-a-household-name" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">based on two real-life men</a>. Sonny is desperate for money to pay for his trans wife&rsquo;s gender-reassignment surgery, so he plans the heist with friend Sal, the result being a violent debacle. With an eye on queer liberation, the movie tackles the failures of the counterculture while gleefully thumbing its nose at the cops. It&rsquo;s a fabulous heist movie&mdash;one of the best movies of its era, period&mdash;and doesn&rsquo;t look down on its lead character&rsquo;s bisexuality, nor his marriage to a trans woman. <strong>You can rent <em>Dog Day Afternoon</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YOEN?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=a5YOEN&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Even if much of the cast is straight, <em>Rocky Horror</em> went from being a cult classic to a rite of passage for your queers, full of gleefully over-the-top characters who either start out as sex-and-gender fluid, or who get there by the end. It&rsquo;s survived because it&rsquo;s so much fun (even if, or maybe because, the plot makes almost no sense), and because it somehow also caught on with straight audiences who want to walk on the wild side for a few hours, with Brad and Janet serving as their able guides. If they can let their hair down and party with Dr. Frank-N-Furter and the gang, maybe there&rsquo;s hope for this world. <strong>You can rent <em>Rocky Horror</em> from Prime Video.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>William Friedkin returned to queer cinema (after <em>Boys in the Band</em>) with far more mixed results, both in terms of the film's quality and its reception. Based on a novel that was, itself, inspired by a string of real murders, the movie sees Al Pacino as a cop sent undercover into the NYC leather scene in order to find the person who's killing his hook-ups. Focusing on more extreme, but not entirely unrealistic, elements of the cruising scene at the time, the movie was protested by gay groups even during production. Given that the number of mainstream gay films was nearly zero in 1980, it was hard for people to get behind a portrayal of queer life so heavily tilted toward violence and fisting, whatever Friedkin's best intentions. Ultimately, it's entirely too goofy and nonsensical (though often quite fun) to get mad at, and the conversation that sprung up around it gave voice to a growing cinematic constituency. <strong>You can rent <em>Cruising</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXrwl?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QpXrwl&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Following the comparatively more progressive 1970s, the 1980s were an era when queer movies were either justifiably HIV/AIDS focused, or all about gay/bisexual serial killers (<em>Dressed to Kill</em>, <em>Cruising</em>, etc.) <em>Desert Hearts</em> bucks both of those trends in the best ways. Vivian (Helen Shaver ), an English professor in the middle of a divorce, meets Cay (Patricia Charbonneau), an uninhibited sculptor, at a ranch in Reno. Though Vivian struggles a bit with the unexpected lesbian attraction, the romantic drama steers clear of tragedy entirely. <strong>You can stream <em>Desert Hearts</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrXnLm?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=QrXnLm&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> and The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWwoNA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QWwoNA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>An early triumph of intersectionality, this adaptation of the Hanif Kaueishi novel introduces Omar (Gordon Warnecke), the new owner of a run-down laundromat who winds up back in a relationship with his one-time Nazi punk boyfriend Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis). It&rsquo;s a great film about class and racism that provides a vivid portrait of life in the Thatcher/Reagan-era 1980s. It&rsquo;s also a romance that suggests there&rsquo;s hope for moving forward from the mistakes of the past while reminding us forgiveness is never guaranteed. <strong>You can rent <em>My Beautiful Laundrette</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gOkMe?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9gOkMe&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Ball culture is still very much with us, both in its purest form in major American cities, and by having expanded into the mainstream (more or less) thanks to Madonna and <em>RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race</em>. <em>Paris is Burning</em> captures the joys and heartbreaks of a particular moment (New York City in the late 1980s) when black and latino gay, trans, and genderqueer performers were burning up the stages in something like a golden age of drag, even while racism, poverty, anti-trans violence, and HIV/AIDS were destroying their lives. In some ways, it&rsquo;s a glorious document of a bygone era; in others ways, good and bad, it feels entirely relevant to our present era. When you&rsquo;re done here, catch 2016's <em>Kiki</em>,  a more recent documentary that updates the story of ball culture (what&rsquo;s changed, and what hasn&rsquo;t). <strong>You can stream <em>Paris is Burning</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBpYrM?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=aBpYrM&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> and The Criterion Channel.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>New Queer Cinema pioneer Gregg Araki&rsquo;s best-known film is likely <em>Mysterious Skin</em>, but his angry, freewheeling early work <em>The Living End</em> is the purest expression of his talents as a filmmaker. Having survived a decade during which queer people were demonized (more than usual even) and then ignored when faced with a plague, Araki responded with a primal scream in which a couple of HIV positive drifters kill a homophobic cop and take off on a &ldquo;fuck everything&rdquo;-themed road trip. <strong>You can stream T<em>he Living End</em> on Kanopy or rent it from Prime Video.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Though played by straight cis (apparently) actors, the three traveling drag queens at the center of Stephan Elliott's deliberately campy lark bring a sense of fun and adventure to this Australian road trip. The three actual queens&mdash;Cindy Pastel, Strykermyer and Lady Bump&mdash;on whose lives the movie is based were originally intended to play themselves before the studio intervened, so I'm going to knock off a few points for that missed opportunity for authenticity. Still, the movie is fun, funny, and positive, a far cry from most of the queer-themed movies of the era. Its worldwide popularity (on a barely-there budget) almost certainly moved the needle a bit on queer, and particularly trans, representation. <strong>You can stream <em>Priscilla</em> on Kanopy and Tubi or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmXb0N?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QmXb0N&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Though its synopsis has more to do with finding love and overcoming the fear of dying (HIV/AIDS is very much front and center), there&rsquo;s a joyful, frothy quality to <em>Jeffrey</em> that&rsquo;s understandably lacking in most of the many other movies in which AIDS is a primary topic. This one&rsquo;s a charming (and sex-positive) rom-com with cute lead performances from Steven Weber and Michael T. Weiss, and a scene-stealing appearance by Patrick Stewart. <strong>You can stream <em>Jeffrey</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7E6dy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Peacock&amp;short_url=z7E6dy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Peacock</a></strong><strong>, Tubi, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXLN0?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Freevee&amp;short_url=QpXLN0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Freevee</a></strong><strong>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXLN0?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QpXLN0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Cheryl Dunye&rsquo;s low-budget rom-com deserved to have as significant a cultural impact as the era&rsquo;s other independent hit set in a video store&mdash;<em>Clerks&mdash;</em>but instead had to settle for cult status. Dunye plays herself, sort of, as an aspiring filmmaker and a young, Black lesbian exploring the life of a fictional film mammy from Hollywood&rsquo;s golden age, the title&rsquo;s Watermelon Woman. Aside from being genuinely funny and unpretentious, the movie has a lot of smart things to say, and smart questions to ask, about the lives and experiences of queer Black people. <strong>You can stream <em>The Watermelon Woman</em> on The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4ygd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aN4ygd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Queer themes abound in the works of Lana and Lily Wachowski, by far the most successful trans directors in the history of the medium. This transgressive lesbian neo-noir, their very first film, sends up major sparks in its depiction of the relationship between dueling femmes fatale, Gina Gershon's Corky and Jennifer Tilly's Violet. Queer characters in movies at the time could be the subject of jokes, or angry, or sad, but <em>Bound</em> made a strong case that same-sex attraction is simply <em>hot</em>. <strong>You can rent <em>Bound</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXem6?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QqXem6&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The elliptical narrative and deliberate pacing might have turned off some viewers, but Wong Kar-wai&rsquo;s frank story of a gay couple (played by Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai) who travel from Hong Kong to Argentina to escape an extremely troubled, and even abusive relationship, it a poetic triumph. Don&rsquo;t let the title fool you: these two aren&rsquo;t really shouldn&rsquo;t be together, but the performances are transfixing, and Wong&rsquo;s style is as beautiful as it is memorable. <strong>You can stream <em>Happy Together</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXbKE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=9lXbKE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> and The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z542K?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9Z542K&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Thanks to the New Queer Cinema movement, the &lsquo;90s were an absolute golden age for films with LGBTQ+ themes, often with righteous anger at the repressive, near-genocidal &lsquo;80s as their driving force. Pedro Almod&oacute;var&rsquo;s films, on the other hand, do something different: they&rsquo;re colorful and joyous, even as they speak to unpleasant truths. Here, grieving mother Manuela goes on something like a road trip to find her son&rsquo;s father, Lola, a trans woman who doesn&rsquo;t even know she has a son. Along the way, she meets up with her old friend Agrado, herself a trans sex worker who, among the film&rsquo;s many eclectic characters, serves as the Manuela&rsquo;s rock and the film&rsquo;s most fully realized human being. <strong>You can rent <em>All About My Mother</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrX0R1?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QrX0R1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Dee Rees brings a confident, assured style to <em>Pariah</em>, not to mention a stunningly beautiful visual style that ensures it doesn&rsquo;t look like any other movie. It&rsquo;s a vibrant and deeply personal coming-of-age/coming out story that never feels like a lesbian message movie, signaling a new era of more complex narratives centered on queer characters. <strong>You can rent <em>Pariah</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORMvj?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QORMvj&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>This is probably the most fun you&rsquo;ll ever have watching a girlfriend/buddy/revenge comedy movie about two trans sex workers on the hunt for the man who did one of them wrong. As heartfelt as it is madcap, it puts us more firmly in a cinematic era in which more and more complex queerdos are making their ways to the screen. Shot on a couple of iPhones, director Sean Baker and company make a virtue of the intimacy and immediacy that modern technology can bring. <strong>You can stream <em>Tangerine</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD30wX?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=aD30wX&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXVDR?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9wXVDR&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Prime Video</em></a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Sometimes it helps to have everything laid out in front of us, as <em>Disclosure</em> does in an entertaining, but methodical, fashion. With input from trans celebrities, including Laverne Cox, Jamie Clayton, Chaz Bono, Michaela Ja&eacute; Rodriguez, Candis Cayne, Lilly Wachowski, Leo Sheng, and many others, it examines the history of trans representation in film for good (some) and for ill (mostly). The chief argument is that trans people are much more (and much more diverse) than their cinematic counterparts, and that while there has been progress in terms of authentic portrayals, it has been slow. <strong>You can stream <em>Disclosure</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81284247" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

      <description>It's been a wild ride, people.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The TikTok ban has been a rollercoaster, to say the least. Is the app banned? Is the app saved? What the hell is going on? These are the questions everyone's asking, and there are answers&mdash;at least to some of them. <br><br>Let's break the last few days down, to catch everyone up to speed with that's going on with TikTok. </p><h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here" target="_blank">To very briefly recap</a>, the government has been gunning to ban TikTok since the first Trump administration. Last year, Congress and the Biden administration passed a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States, unless ByteDance divested its stake in the app by Jan. 19. ByteDance insisted it wouldn't sell, and as the deadline approached, things got heated. TikTok went to the Supreme Court to argue the ban violated the company's First Amendment rights, but SCOTUS ruled in favor of the government. </p><p>With this final defeat, TikTok swore it'd go dark unless the Biden administration stepped in to block the ban. The administration, however, punted the problem to the incoming Trump administration, saying the Biden administration would not enforce the law, and that TikTok had no reason to act before then. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-will-keep-tiktok-going-dark-if-deal-is-table-adviser-says-2025-01-16/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">we learned Trump was reportedly considering signing an executive order</a> to extend the timeline for the ban, which seemed to line with the Biden administration's position. </p><h2 id="saturday-jan-18">Saturday, Jan. 18</h2><p>That brings us to Saturday, one day before the ban was set to take effect. All eyes were on the situation, since no one really knew what would happen once we reached Jan. 19 in the U.S. The law is quite clear that, once the deadline passed, no companies could distribute, maintain, or update TikTok or its services, so it was reasonable to think TikTok would disappear from app stores in the country. </p><p>However, the language of the law was less clear about whether TikTok could continue operating in the U.S. at all. Companies could not provide internet hosting services to distribute, maintain, or update TikTok, but does that include hosting as well? The Biden administration didn't seem to think so, which is why they pushed back on TikTok's threats to go dark. According to the administration, TikTok should continue operating as normal (albeit, without being able to serve new users), and wait for the Trump administration to deal with the situation.</p><p>Well, TikTok didn't do that. Instead, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-banned-pop-up-open-the-app" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the app went totally dark Saturday night</a>, at least an hour and a half before the deadline was official. Users trying to access the app were greeted by a message informing them the app was banned in their country, and they could not use it at the moment. Shortly after, however, the pop-up was updated, to include an appeal to incoming President Trump: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!" Pretty subtle, TikTok.</p><p>With the app now dark in the U.S., users turned to alternative methods to try to access TikTok. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-tiktok-if-its-banned-in-the-us" target="_blank">I had written about how a VPN should theoretically get around the ban</a>, since it would make your internet traffic look as if it was coming from a country that allowed the app. However, TikTok anticipated users doing this, and decided to block traffic from American accounts entirely. The only way I was able to access TikTok via VPN was through Safari, and it was very particular about which countries would work. (Routing my traffic through Japan, for example, returned an error, but when I used Romania, it worked fine.)</p><h2 id="sunday-jan-19">Sunday, Jan. 19</h2><p>TikTok remained dark through Sunday morning and into the early afternoon. It wasn't clear what the timeline would look like: Trump was being sworn in the next day, so would TikTok wait until a theoretical executive order before returning service?</p><p>The answer was no: One day before Trump took office, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-goes-dark-us-users-trump-says-save-tiktok-2025-01-19/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">he started talking about how</a> "we have to save [TikTok]." Evidently, that was enough for TikTok, which started coming back online for American users starting around 1 p.m. ET. The whole affair lasted fewer than 15 hours, but it showed how TikTok felt about both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration. </p><h2 id="monday-jan-20">Monday, Jan. 20</h2><p>Of course, Trump took the oath of office on Monday, returning to the White House and reassuming the power of the presidency. (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-20/tiktok-ceo-joins-trump-s-inauguration-with-app-s-future-in-doubt" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">In attendance was TikTok CEO Shou Chew</a>.) As part of a flurry of executive orders following the inauguration, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-tells-justice-department-not-enforce-tiktok-ban-75-days-rcna188377" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Trump issued an order to delay TikTok's ban by 75 days</a>. The order directs the Justice Department not to enforce the law during this time period, in an effort to find a buyer for TikTok. ByteDance and China both have remained steadfast that TikTok would not be sold, but following Trump's inauguration, the latter has shown potential interest in selling. </p><h2 id="tuesday-jan-21">Tuesday, Jan. 21</h2><p>The situation is largely the same as of Tuesday, minus one key event: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/01/21/trump-warns-fate-of-tiktok-deal-could-impact-china-tariffs-beijing-signals-it-may-not-block-sale/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Trump seems to be threatening China with tariffs</a> if they get in the way of a deal to buy TikTok. Specifically, Trump said, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;d put tariffs on China&hellip;I&rsquo;m not saying we would, but we certainly could do that.&rdquo;</p><h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h2><p>This unprecedented situation has certainly been volatile. It was Trump himself who wanted to ban TikTok during his first term. Now, he and TikTok want to spin the situation to make Trump a "savior."  </p><p>But TikTok is far from out of the woods here. Apple and Google have not restored TikTok (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apps-bytedance-operates-in-united-states" target="_blank">or any of its other properties</a>, like CapCut), and it doesn't seem clear they will while the company's legal situation is in flux. Speaking of which, the TikTok "ban" is still the law: It's truly unclear what power Trump has as president to extend the timeline here, when the law went into effect a day before he took office. The law gives the president the ability to extend the deadline by 90 days if ByteDance was actively looking to divest, but the deadline passed, so what does that mean for Trump?</p><p>Trump has said he wants a U.S. company to have a 50% stake in TikTok. That's not as strict as the original law, which wants a U.S.-based company to control the app outright. Perhaps that type of deal would appeal more to ByteDance or the Chinese government, who would still regain half of the assets.</p><p>We now know what a TikTok ban in the U.S. looks like: TikTok goes dark, users can't access their accounts if they were created in this country, and VPNs mainly seem to work on the web. The question now is whether we'll see a true ban happen later this year, or whether we'll see ByteDance sell some or all of the app instead.</p><p>I'll keep this article updated with the latest news regarding TikTok's ban. For now, you can continue to use it as normal&mdash;assuming you downloaded the app before Saturday night.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Roborock Saros 10 Is Great (but It's Not My Favorite Roborock)</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>At the Consumer Electronics Show (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/ces-conference-news" target="_blank">CES</a>) this year, <a href="https://us.roborock.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Roborock</a> announced it was changing the naming convention for its high-end robots to SAROS (I&rsquo;m told this is not an acronym for anything). A lot of attention was paid to the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/roborock-saros-z70-vacuum-robot-arm" target="_blank">Saros Z70,</a> which has an "arm" that can pick items up, but Roborock also released two additional robot vacuums&mdash;the Saros 10 and Saros 10r. I&rsquo;ve had the 10 running in my home for a few weeks now, and it's a great peek into the future of floor-cleaning robots, as it has many features we saw all over CES. </p><p>Overall, I was pleased by the Saros 10; it&rsquo;s clearly the successor to the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-review" target="_blank">S8</a> line from Roborock, with a number of improvements, and while I thought it was much better than many other robot vacuums I've tested recently, I didn't think it was better than other Roborocks currently out. </p><h2 id="the-saros-10-has-sleek-metal-build">The Saros 10 has sleek metal build</h2><p>For the last few iterations of robots, Roborock has relied on molded black or white plastic with metal accents. Recently, it diverged from the boxy shape most robot docks offer with the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/roborock-curv-robot-vacuum-review" target="_blank">Curv</a>, which lives up to its name with a soft arc to the design. The Saros 10 looks downright futuristic, leaning heavily on polished metal with curvy white (or black) metal accents. Unlike other brands that are building docks that look like skyscrapers, the Roborock docks continue to be a bit wider but lower to the ground, able to tuck under more spaces.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Under the hood of the 10 is the dirty and clean water tank, which each hold about four liters of water. A panel on the front of the dock pops open to reveal the vacuum bag and dedicated dock for a cleaning solution. Even better, this is simply a container; you don&rsquo;t have to purchase brand-specific cartridges; you can use whatever solution you want, although obviously Roborock advises you use <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOZbG?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=theirs&amp;short_url=QKOZbG&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">theirs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The robot itself is thinner than previous versions of this brand or others. While I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-should-put-your-coffee-table-on-casters-1850369665" target="_blank">lifted</a> much of my furniture to make it easier for robots (or myself) to clean, the Saros 10 even snuggled under the middle of the couch that sags a little.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-lidar-tower-on-the-saros-10-is-retractable">The LiDAR tower on the Saros 10 is retractable</h2><p>The way the Saros 10 manages to be so thin is by starting to move away from LiDAR, the mapping system almost all robot vacuums have used for the past year or two. This light-based technology required a small tower (that looks like a button) on robot vacuums in recent years that made it a bit taller. The 10 makes that tower retractable, so when the robot is navigating in spaces that are a little tight&mdash;say, under a table or couch&mdash;it disappears into the robot. At that point, the robot relies on cameras, lights, and a little AI.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t too unusual; most robots are going in this direction, getting an assist from AI and onboard cameras that help distinguish what is in front of a robot, and whether they should ignore it (such as if your pet had a recent accident) or traverse it (say, a cord). Roborock has a lot of fancy branded words for this new navigation and AI, but ultimately, it means the robot can work at night, in tight spaces, and is less likely to get stuck.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-roborock-app-experience-remains-great">The Roborock app experience remains great</h2><p>Like its predecessors, the Saros 10 comes out of the hulking box put together; all you need to do is plug it in and dock the robot. It paired within seconds by scanning a QR code on the robot itself, and as soon as I loaded up the water tank it was ready for a maiden voyage.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, this initial visit is where the robot leaves the dock, and using LiDAR, creates an uncomfortably accurate linear map of your space within seconds just by &ldquo;looking around.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Saros 10, perhaps due to the additional power of the cameras and AI, took a less cursory look around, poking its nose into every corner of the room. What it revealed at the end was a map that, yes, was accurate in terms measuring the space, but also layered in information that no other robot app had caught in such detail.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time, every piece of furniture, every rug, and every cord was laid out in the app. It doesn&rsquo;t understand that the obstacle it is encountering is an air purifier, but it nailed the shape of it in the app. This is important for two reasons: First, having accurate landmarks in the room makes creating cleaning zones much more accurate&mdash;usually they&rsquo;re a guess. Second, it shows how useful that AI is, since identifying correctly what the robot is encountering means that it can more accurately decide how to deal with that item. A low pile carpet needs different pressure than tile floor.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>All the other aspects of the Roborock app that I love, including pin-and-go feature, which allows you to pin a spot on the ground and the robot will go there and, if you&rsquo;d like, clean it. I also love the remote control feature, which turns the app into a remote for the robot, so you can direct it wherever you like.</p><h2 id="more-suction-doesnt-translate-to-a-better-vacuum">More suction doesn&rsquo;t translate to a better vacuum</h2><p>Over the last few weeks, meeting with the engineers who made lots of the robots that debuted at CES, I was able to truly nerd out on the sorts of details most people would find banal. Among them, the design of the sweeping arm for the vacuum has changed to be two pronged instead of three, and it swings out, away from the robot to gather more dust and get closer to the wall. And while other robots vacillate between one roller or two, the Saros is the first I&rsquo;ve seen to feature a split roller design, which Roborock says will all but eliminate hair getting caught up in the machine.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I found these elements to work well to gather detritus off the floor, whether from a rug, carpet, tile, or wood. While it did a good job, I didn&rsquo;t think it did as well as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RwXM?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Curv&amp;short_url=z3RwXM&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Curv</a> or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4dwy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Narwal%20Freo%20Z&amp;short_url=zj4dwy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Narwal Freo Z</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More interesting, the Saros 10 has a <em>stupid</em> amount of suction power: 22,000Pa. That&rsquo;s more than twice of most of the robots we saw last year, and yet, to be honest, it didn&rsquo;t seem to make a big difference to me. I&rsquo;ve asked engineers why the Pa is going so high&mdash;and does it even matter&mdash;and at least one admitted to me that it was mostly for marketing purposes.&nbsp;You shouldn't ignore this number when shopping for a robot, but it shouldn't be the deciding factor either. </p><h2 id="saros-10-returns-to-the-mop-pad">Saros 10 returns to the mop pad</h2><p>The main difference between the previous lines&mdash;the S8 and the QRevo line&mdash;was in the mops. The QRevo line features two spinning pads, while the S8 line has one vibrating mop pad. I&rsquo;d always preferred the pad because it simply cleaned better. But as more and more robots moved to spinning pads, I reconsidered. After thirty minutes of the Saros 10 mopping with its one vibrating mop pad, I remembered how much better they worked getting real grime off the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of the Saros, this is aided by two additional factors: First, the 176&deg; water that is constantly cleaning the pad. Second, the chassis on the robot&mdash;basically the robot itself&mdash;can lift its front end. While this is intended to help it navigate spaces better, it has also been leveraged to exert pressure on the backend of the robot, where the pad is, and thus, the mop gets better contact with the floor.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-saros-10-doesnt-climb-stairs-but-it-thinks-it-does">The Saros 10 doesn&rsquo;t climb stairs (but it thinks it does)</h2><p>Another company, Dreame, introduced a &ldquo;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/dreame-x50-ultra-robot-vacuum-can-climb-over-small-obstacles" target="_blank">stair climbing</a>&rdquo; robot this year (which, for the record, can only climb two-inch tall inclines). The thing is, the Saros 10 can&rsquo;t be far behind, as it repeatedly climbed thresholds in my home that approached two inches. That means your robot can get itself into a lot of trouble. Mine kept falling off a tall threshold that no other robot could do more than bump into. The point of the chassis lifting isn&rsquo;t to climb stairs (yet); it's to help your robot get over cords and other obstacles in the way. It&rsquo;s interesting to watch the robot try to navigate space using the AI on board. In many ways, it&rsquo;s aspirational, attempting to do more than it should.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That&rsquo;s where the AI is actually useful, even if you&rsquo;re a skeptic like me. Each time the robot ventured out, it got better. It was clearly learning about both my space and my belongings.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>The Saros 10 is probably a better investment than many other robots in its price range ($1,399 <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxolE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=when%20it%20comes%20out&amp;short_url=QbxolE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>when it comes out</u></a> Feb. 10). I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a better robot than other Roborocks. If you needed to buy one tomorrow, I&rsquo;d likely recommend the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXVPl?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Curv&amp;short_url=znXVPl&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Curv</u></a>; but if you can hold off, I&rsquo;d wait to see how the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXrRZ?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Saros%20Z70&amp;short_url=QpXrRZ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Saros Z70</u></a> (the one with the arm) gets reviewed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Spatchcocking Your Chicken Is Worth the Effort</title>

      <description>Those thighs aren't going to crisp tucked way under there.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J6W80APKZG4AV6N6DSH7SH7P/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roast chicken is an everyday pleasure&mdash;a good fit for both special occasions and midnight snacks. While you might be familiar with the classic roasting style, with trussed legs and tucked wings, this method can lead to overcooked breasts and soggy thighs&mdash;two phrases I want nowhere near my chicken. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a better way to roast your chicken for more even cooking: spatchcocking. It's not overly difficult, and it's absolutely worth the extra effort involved.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-spatchcock-your-roast-chicken">Why you should spatchcock your roast chicken</h2><p>You can spatchcock any bird. You might also hear it called butterflying, but the method is the same. (Not to be confused with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/butterfly-your-meat-for-quicker-more-even-cooking-1850149845" target="_blank">butterflying chicken breast</a>.) Essentially, the goal of this method is to lay the chicken out flat so all its muscular parts are on the same level. Imagine the paper core of a roll of toilet paper. If you make one cut down the length of it, you can unfurl it to turn it into a flat piece of paper. Spatchcocking is like that, but the steps involved are a bit more macabre.</p><p>Traditional roasting puts the driest cut of meat (the breast of the chicken) at the top, often closest to the heating element&mdash;before you've even turned up the heat, it&rsquo;s a recipe for overcooking. The parts that are juiciest (i.e. the thighs) are lower, if not completely under the rest of the body, and shielded from direct heat. This means by the time the thighs reach 165&deg;F (the goal temperature for cooked poultry) the breast will have long surpassed that.&nbsp;</p><p>Spatchcocked chicken is my favorite way to roast because all that uneven cooking is taken out of the equation. The chicken&rsquo;s spine is removed during preparation, allowing the carcass to be flattened. This means the thighs, legs, and breasts are arranged evenly so they can all cook at the same time. Additionally, the increased surface area means the heat can access more of the chicken at once, cooking it faster. </p><p>But the most important reason spatchcocking  is my favorite roasting method is the crispy skin. I dislike the soggy skin that results from the thighs cooking while tucked under the body. The skin on a spatchcocked chicken is crispy throughout, and that's reason enough for me.</p><h2 id="how-to-spatchcock-a-chicken">How to spatchcock a chicken</h2><h3>1. Prepare the chicken</h3><p>Place the chicken on a large cutting board or sheet tray, breast-side facing down. The wee little tail flap should be closest to you. Place a wire rack over a baking sheet and set nearby.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>2. Cut out the spine</h3><p>Sharp poultry shears are the absolute best thing for this job, though I&rsquo;ve removed a few spines with regular kitchen shears; they just require a bit more force. Using the shears, cut along one side of the spine, from the tail end to the neck end. Repeat on the other side of the backbone until it has been completely freed from the body of the bird.

<p>You can also use a sharp knife to remove a spine; just insert the tip of the knife on one side of the spine (to secure it) and press downward. You&rsquo;ll be able to feel the blade go through the bones. Stop the pressure before cutting through to the breast. Repeat on the other side of the backbone.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Flatten the bird</h3><p>Flip the chicken over so the opening is facing down and the breasts are facing up. Press down firmly on the breastplate. (You&rsquo;ll likely hear it crack.) Next, flatten out the breast, wings, thighs, and legs so they&rsquo;re all facing upward&mdash;the chicken's legs will point inward like it's doing a pee-pee dance. The bird should stay flat when you release it, so if it rounds up again, you need to press harder.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>4. Season and roast</h3><p>Rub oil or softened butter all over the chicken, tuck herbs under the skin if you wish, and season your all over with salt. I like to tuck some lemon slices and rosemary under the chicken too, but you can put other hearty veggies or aromatics under the wire rack. Place the chicken on the wire rack over the baking sheet. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Roast your chicken at 425&deg;F for 35 to 45 minutes, depending on its size. If you aren't sure if it has cooked through, check the temperature; you want the breast to reach 160&deg;F, and the thighs should measure around 165&deg;F at the same time. The carry-over temperature will continue cooking the meat for the next few minutes even out of the oven.&nbsp;</p><p>After letting your chicken rest for about 15 minutes, you can <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-carve-a-chicken" target="_blank"><u>carve it into sections</u></a>. I think you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s even easier than usual: When a roast chicken has been spatchcocked, the joints are already free, and carving something flat is way more stable than doing so with a rounded object. Now, go enjoy your perfectly roasted chicken, and tell all your friends about the joys of spatchcocking.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>These Seven Countries Will Grant You a Passport Based on Ancestry</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JJ2SMZXH95BJD6YW6YHZG715</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>If your grandparents were born in these countries, you may be eligible for citizenship.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ2SMZXH95BJD6YW6YHZG715/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-obtain-dual-citizenship-1844326232" target="_blank">handful of ways to obtain dual citizenship</a> in countries around the world, which allows you to carry two separate passports and enjoy the benefits of being a national of two different countries. One option is to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/travel/how-to-buy-residency-in-another-country-golden-visa" target="_blank">spend a lot of money on a "golden passport,"</a> but another is to find out where your ancestors are from and if you qualify for citizenship by descent. </p><p>There are many countries around the world that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis#Current_Jus_sanguinis_states" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">use the principle of jus sanguinis, or "right of blood," to grant citizenship</a>, most often based on the nationality of one or both parents (and sometimes with additional residency requirements). However, there are a handful that consider connections further back in your family line to qualify. If you have grandparents or other ancestors from the following countries, you may be eligible for citizenship too. </p><h2 id="croatia">Croatia</h2><p>Croatia offers <a href="https://www.salonaconsulting.com/en/our-services/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">citizenship by ancestry</a> to descendants of anyone born in the territory now defined as the Republic of Croatia and who emigrated from the area before October 8, 1991. You can claim this based on your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, or further back. You don't need to speak the language, live in the country for any period of time, or have the same last name as your ancestors to qualify&mdash;however, the process can take several years.</p><p>Croatia is one of many countries for which citizenship has been impacted (and complicated) by shifting borders, historical conflicts, and other impacts of globalization and politics. There are a handful of other nations that similarly grant citizenship by ancestry to those with ethnic ties&mdash;such as foreigners of Armenian, Lithuanian, or Bulgarian descent in their respective nations and ethnic Finns from the former Soviet Union&mdash;or whose ancestors were displaced from their homes (like those from Spain, which is covered below). </p><h2 id="hungary">Hungary</h2><p>If your parents or grandparents held Hungarian citizenship, you can apply for citizenship by descent (<a href="https://washington.mfa.gov.hu/eng/page/about-hungarian-citizenship" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">with a few specific exceptions</a>). You don't need to speak Hungarian to be eligible. If your grandparents came from what is now Hungary but lost their citizenship due to treaties signed after WWI or WWII, you can apply for <a href="https://washington.mfa.gov.hu/eng/page/simplified-naturalization" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">simplified naturalization</a>. For the latter process, you do need to have "sufficient" proficiency in Hungarian. </p><h2 id="ireland">Ireland</h2><p>Ireland <a href="https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/citizenship/born-abroad/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">grants citizenship</a> to anyone whose grandparents were born on the island of Ireland. You have to register with the Foreign Births Register, after which you can apply for an Irish passport. There is a <a href="https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/citizenship/born-abroad/registering-a-foreign-birth/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">list of required documents</a> and a fee of 278 euro for applicants over age 18. According to the Ireland Department of Foreign Affairs, processing takes approximately nine months. </p><h2 id="italy">Italy</h2><p>Individuals with Italian ancestors are <a href="https://conslosangeles.esteri.it/en/servizi-consolari-e-visti/servizi-per-il-cittadino-straniero/cittadinanza/citizenship-by-descent/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">eligible for Italian citizenship</a>, even if that ancestor was multiple generations back. The qualifying ancestor has to have been born in the territory after the Kingdom of Italy was formed in 1861 and cannot have held any additional citizenship. An Italian citizenship application costs $643.70 as of Jan. 1, 2025. </p><h2 id="portugal">Portugal</h2><p>If your grandparents were born in Portugal and have or had Portuguese citizenship, you can apply for <a href="https://washingtondc.embaixadaportugal.mne.gov.pt/en/consular-services/consular-services/acquisition-of-portuguese-nationality-through-grandparents" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">naturalization through ancestry</a>. You must have proof of proficiency in Portuguese and provide documents like your parents' and grandparents' birth certificates. The application fee is 175 euro. </p><h2 id="spain">Spain</h2><p>Spanish citizenship is granted to descendants of some people of Spanish origin under the relatively recent Grandchildren's Law. If your grandparent (or parent) was exiled, renounced, or lost their Spanish nationality or could not become a citizen, you may be eligible for a Spanish passport. However, you <a href="https://administracion.gob.es/pag_Home/en/Tu-espacio-europeo/derechos-obligaciones/ciudadanos/residencia/obtencion-nacionalidad.html#-0d5ec9d93410" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">must renounce your original citizenship</a> unless you are from certain Latin American countries, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, Portugal, or are a Sephardic Jew of Spanish origin.</p><h2 id="united-kingdom">United Kingdom</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">UK Ancestry visa</a> doesn't grant full citizenship up front, but it does allow you to live, work, and/or study in the UK for up to five years (and to bring your partner and/or minor child with you). After this, you may be able to extend your stay for five more years or apply for "indefinite leave to remain," which can lead to citizenship eligibility after 12 months. </p><p>To qualify, you have to be a citizen of <a href="https://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a Commonwealth country</a> or Zimbabwe or be a British overseas citizen or national. You also have to prove that one of your grandparents was born in the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man. An ancestry visa costs &pound;637 and requires an application with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa/documents-you-must-provide" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">extensive documentation</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Finally, an Easier Way to Change Your Default Browser on Mac</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JJ29YBQXAF5H2NNYBHSDRJWE</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>This $4 app will keep you from having to dig around in your system settings.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ29YBQXAF5H2NNYBHSDRJWE/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alas, one internet browser cannot do it all. Perhaps you need to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/6-of-the-best-internet-browsers-for-protecting-your-pri-1847604085" target="_blank">swap to another browser for  extra privacy</a>, or you're trying out the new AI browser on the block. Copying and pasting links between browsers can be a pain itself, and so is going to the browser settings to change your default browser. Luckily, Mac users can avoid all of this with the Default Browser menu bar app.</p><p>Sindre Sorhus is a serial indie app developer that specializes in creating niche apps that solve a particularly nagging problem in an often seamless way. <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/default-browser" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Default Browser</a> is one of my favorites (and we've already talked about his other apps like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-mac-app-makes-finder-more-like-windows-file-explorer" target="_blank">Supercharge</a>, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/aiko-free-ai-transcription-app" target="_blank">Aiko</a>, and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/download-this-app-if-you-use-multiple-browsers-on-your-1850083609" target="_blank">Velja</a>).</p><h2 id="how-to-customize-the-default-browser-app">How to customize the Default Browser app</h2><p>The Default Browser app is available directly from the developer's website for $4. After installation, you'll just need to make a trip to your System Settings to give the app Accessibility permissions (the app needs these to function), but aside from that, it couldn't be easier. </p><p>At it's core, it's really simple. You click on the <strong>Globe</strong> icon in the menu bar to open the Default Browser app, and click on one of the browsers to switch to it. By default, though, it's going to be empty, so let's start by customizing the app.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ29YBQXAF5H2NNYBHSDRJWE/images-1.fill.size_2000x1450.v1737391812.png" alt="Customizing Default Browser on Mac." width="2000" height="1450" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ29YBQXAF5H2NNYBHSDRJWE/images-1.fill.size_800x580.v1737391812.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ29YBQXAF5H2NNYBHSDRJWE/images-1.fill.size_1400x1015.v1737391812.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ29YBQXAF5H2NNYBHSDRJWE/images-1.fill.size_2000x1450.v1737391812.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide"></span>
                                        <span class="text-xs inline-block text-gray-600">Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>First, click the <strong>Settings</strong> button, then click the <strong>Choose</strong> button under the <strong>Browsers</strong> section, then enable the browsers that you want to see on the list. You can use the little handle icons to drag and re-arrange their order, too. </p><p>Once that's done, I would highly recommend creating a keyboard shortcut for the app using the <strong>Toggle menu</strong> option. I've personally set it to <strong>Command+Shift+D</strong>. Using the keyboard shortcut will bring up the Default Browser menu bar app even if you've hidden it using an app like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ice-menu-bar-app-best-bartender-alternative" target="_blank">Ice</a>. Then, you can use a number to quickly switch to a new default browser (for me, I press the "2" key to switch to Firefox instantly, a browser I use for Lifehacker's CMS). This little change itself makes Default Browser really quick, simple, and easy to use.</p><p>Default Browser is also compatible with the Shortcuts app, so you can set up automations to change the default browser from anywhere (even setting up a unique keyboard shortcut for each browser).</p><p>But things get more interesting when you integrate Default Browser with <a href="https://www.numberfive.co/detail_shortery.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Shortery</a>. Shortery is a third-party app that brings <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/shortery-adds-automations-to-macos-shortcuts" target="_blank">automations to Shortcuts</a> on the Mac. Default Browser integrates with Shortery via Shortcuts, letting you create automation workflows based on your browser usage. For example, you can create an automation that switches your default browser to Microsoft Edge when you open the Microsoft Teams app.</p><p>The app also has support for Focus Filters. Go to <strong>System Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Focus</strong>, choose your <strong>Focus mode</strong>, and then scroll down to <strong>Focus Filter</strong>. Here, you can add a new filter that switches your default browser when you switch to a focus mode. If you use different focus modes for personal and work life, you can use this feature to tie them to separate browsers as well.</p><h2 id="for-more-complex-workflows-theres-velja">For more complex workflows, there's Velja</h2><p>For most use cases, Default Browser is a great choice, especially when you enable automations and keyboard shortcuts. But if you have complex needs, check out the Velja app. It's from the same developer, and is kind of like Default Browser's big brother.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Here, you can set up rules that are specific to links from particular apps. Personally, I have a rule setup that automatically opens Google Meet links from WhatsApp in Google Chrome. My default browser is Safari, but Google Meet works best in Chrome, so when I go to open my weekly meditation community meetings, they now automatically open in Chrome, skipping the frustrating copy-and-paste dance every time.

      <description>This immersive choose-your-own-adventure game uses storytelling to make mental health tools more accessible.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ2MEJKAKKRM04S447QWSZRX/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&rsquo;s January 2025. The main character of this story is drowning in uncertainty. She has barely recovered from the holiday season, monumental goals for the new year are looming, and a wall of self-doubt and societal pessimism obscures any view of what the immediate future might look like. The Oracle of Instagram Ads appears, recommending an app that&rsquo;s like a &ldquo;shamanic journey&rdquo; for mental health.&nbsp;</em></p><p>That is how I came to download <a href="https://www.betwixt.life/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Betwixt</u></a>, put on my headphones, and enter a frozen wasteland where a disembodied voice guided me to transfigure my inner landscape.</p><h2 id="what-is-betwixt">What is Betwixt?&nbsp;</h2><p>Betwixt, which the creators describe as &ldquo;an epic journey of self-discovery,&rdquo; is a text-based choose-your-own-adventure type game that scratches multiple itches: gameplay, storytelling, meditation, mental wellness education, audio engagement, and aesthetics.</p><p>To use the app, you should ideally wear headphones and be in a space where you won&rsquo;t be disturbed for 15-20 minutes. For each session or segment of the story, you enter &ldquo;the in-between,&rdquo; a sort of liminal space that exists inside your mind and outside reality. While atmospheric audio plays, the story scrolls across your screen. There are frequent prompts for you to choose the next action or respond to a direct question from the voice accompanying you.&nbsp;</p><p>With storytelling and self-reflection, you are guided through milestones while being prompted to meditate on your strengths, hangups, and tools for coping. You can experience the first three dream sessions for free, then you will be prompted to pay a one-time fee to continue through all 11 chapters. When I signed up, membership tiers ranged from $20-200.</p><p>Each dream session includes some or all of these features:</p><ul><li><p>The interactive dream/story</p></li><li><p>An article relevant to the story&rsquo;s topic</p></li><li><p>An audio track</p></li><li><p>Replayable activities from the session</p></li><li><p>A journal prompt</p></li><li><p>A meditation</p></li><li><p>A quote to save or share</p></li></ul><p>I chose the membership tier ($59) that would allow me to replay any of the dream sessions and have access to the Infinite Dream, a supplemental at-your-own-pace experience.</p><h2 id="how-the-game-helped-me">How the game helped me</h2><p>The narrative format of this app has allowed me to grasp some mental health skills that have been elusive through therapy or other forms of psycho-education.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the technique of psychological distancing&mdash;seeing my problem from a perspective outside my own frantic mind&mdash;actually clicked because the story in Betwixt guided me through the whole process of leaving my body and seeing my problem from a different angle, considering an outsider&rsquo;s interpretation, and refocusing on the future. </p><p>Betwixt co-founder Ellie Dee said this way of learning through story is one key benefit of an app like Betwixt. &ldquo;Rationally, you can understand the maladaptive thinking patterns behind negative emotions and behaviors, but understanding the problem doesn&rsquo;t necessarily solve it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People learn best experientially, through play."  </p><p>Each dream session provides one or more mental health tools like psychological distancing; after playing, you have the opportunity to read more on the topic and journal about it.</p><h2 id="how-apps-like-betwixt-fit-into-mental-health-care">How apps like Betwixt fit into mental health care</h2><p>You could easily pack your phone with apps that support meditation, self-care, mood tracking, journaling, breath work, self-discovery, goal setting, and therapy. I use apps like that along with traditional therapy. Betwixt felt like something different that got me excited about where my story could go.</p><p>Psychologist <a href="http://www.stratynerandassociates.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Dr. Alexandra Stratyner</u></a> said apps like Betwixt can supplement traditional mental health care by helping users work toward their goals between sessions.</p><p>&ldquo;They offer an interactive and engaging alternative to traditional methods like journaling or traditional forms of guided meditation, which may not work for everyone,&rdquo; Stratyner said. &ldquo;The immersive gameplay allows users to explore their emotions in a non-threatening, creative way, which may make self-reflection less intimidating. Some apps like this give users the ability to get immediate support, which can be especially helpful in moments of heightened stress or anxiety.&rdquo;</p><h2 id="who-is-betwixt-for">Who is Betwixt for?</h2><p>Consider Betwixt if you enjoy gaming or immersive storytelling, struggle with traditional mindfulness or meditation practices, or if you're looking for a unique mental wellness tool.</p><p>Betwixt could also benefit people with anxiety, Stratyner said.</p><p>&ldquo;Interactive, narrative-driven tools can be particularly effective for addressing mental health issues that benefit from self-reflection, emotional exploration, and stress reduction,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For example, anxiety can be alleviated through the immersive, controlled environment these tools provide, which allows users to confront fears and uncertainties in a safe, virtual space. Immersive, narrative games that target mental health objectives may also offer therapeutic support that enables users to work through difficult experiences at their own pace.&rdquo;</p><p>Betwixt and other apps are not a substitute for therapy and psychiatric care, however. Stratyner said mental health apps fall short when it comes to personalizing interventions based on your history and needs, managing complex and severe mental health issues like suicidal thoughts and trauma-related distress, and monitoring long-term mental health care.</p><p>&ldquo;It's important to keep in mind that this type of approach has limitations when compared to traditional therapy,&rdquo; Stratyner said. &ldquo;Traditional therapy offers immediate feedback and tailored strategies that are difficult to replicate in a game. While gamified tools are helpful adjuncts for skill-building and daily maintenance, they lack the adaptability and emotional support a therapist provides when navigating difficult emotional states or unearthing underlying issues. Having a living person providing therapy also has unique, relational benefits that are well substantiated with research; apps cannot replicate the human factor.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Five Concrete Ways to Lower the Cost of a Home Renovation</title>

      <description>A little sweat equity and some smart choices can help keep the cost of renovating your house down.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ2D3FCJZ3Q7F1W03X424FH3/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renovating your home is an opportunity to personalize a space, improve its usability, and simply have a more beautiful place to live. But there&rsquo;s a price to pay for those benefits&mdash;both in terms of stress and disruption and in terms of money. The average whole house remodel costs anywhere from <a href="https://homeguide.com/costs/house-remodeling-cost" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">$20,000 to $100,000</a>, which is a lot of money for most people. Even if you line up robust financing for the project and focus on projects that will also pay emotional dividends by <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/the-home-renovation-projects-that-will-make-you-happiest" target="_blank">making you happier</a>, splashing out that kind of money will raise anyone&rsquo;s heart rate.</p><p>You probably can&rsquo;t just <a href="https://lifehacker.com/five-home-renovations-never-worth-doing-yourself-1850848046" target="_blank">do all the work yourself</a> to save some cash&mdash;but you <em>can</em> take some steps to keep those costs as low as possible. </p><h2 id="diy-demo">DIY demo</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re going beyond a facelift in your house, chances are you&rsquo;re going to need some <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-do-a-demo-free-remodel" target="_blank">demolition</a> done. This typically costs a few thousand dollars, depending on the scale of the project and the conditions in the house. The good news is that demolition is a facet of home renovation that you can almost certainly do yourself as long as you&rsquo;re very careful and wear protective gear like safety glasses, robust work gloves, and a mask or respirator. Smashing cabinets off the kitchen wall or tearing up floorboards usually requires very little skill and a whole lot of sweat equity, and it can save you some real money.</p><h2 id="be-your-own-general-contractor">Be your own general contractor</h2><p>A lot of people hire general contractors to handle their home renovations for a good reason: Home renovations are complex and require not just management and logistic skills but also a fair knowledge of building codes and every individual discipline involved, from plumbing to masonry.</p><p>But general contractors aren&rsquo;t in it for love&mdash;they typically charge a <a href="https://www.method.me/blog/general-contractor-markup/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">markup of 15-20%</a> on top of the renovation cost. That means you could save a lot of money by acting as your own GC, which is perfectly legal and possible to do. On a large project with a budget of $50,000, for example, acting as your own GC could save you $10,000.</p><p>Or: It could cost you twice as much if you mess it up. Take a moment to ask yourself if you have the time and background to be an effective general contractor, which involves at its most basic level hiring and coordinating several subcontractors, setting up a schedule so everyone can get their part of the work done properly, arranging for permits and inspections, and managing the purchase, delivery, and inspection of materials. It&rsquo;s a big job and often well worth the extra cost&mdash;but if you have some experience in construction and a talent for logistics, it offers a great opportunity to save some cash.</p><h2 id="buy-your-own-materials">Buy your own materials</h2><p>When you hire contractors, they often make acquiring the necessary materials part of their service. Which is great, but it also means you lose control over the costs unless you negotiate it into a contract. Buying your own materials adds an extra bit of complexity to the planning, but can save you some money since you will likely put more energy into finding sales, special offers, and alternative materials than the contractor would have.</p><p>Keep in mind that your contractors may have very good reasons for using a specific brand or level of product, and you may meet resistance if you insist on using an alternative. It pays to listen to expertise. But if there&rsquo;s no discernible difference aside from price, you can save yourself some money by acting as your own procurement officer.</p><h2 id="phase-out-appliances">Phase out appliances</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re renovating a kitchen or laundry room, you can spare yourself some sticker shock with one simple trick: patience. If the appliances still work (and you&rsquo;re not planning on radically changing their size) you can shave a few thousand bucks off the initial renovation cost by keeping them and replacing them over time when things go on sale.</p><p>The average kitchen package (refrigerator, microwave, oven, and dishwasher) runs <a href="https://homeguide.com/costs/appliances-prices" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">between $2,100 and $5,400</a>, and a washer/dryer set can run <a href="https://homeguide.com/costs/washer-and-dryer-cost" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">as much as $2,300</a>. If you can live with the old and busted versions for a while, you can shave close to nine grand off the up-front cost of the reno with the option to upgrade the appliances later whenever it makes sense.</p><h2 id="ask-for-discounts">Ask for discounts</h2><p>Many businesses supplying renovation materials offer trade discounts, so if you have any connection to the construction or real estate world, you might be able to convince them to offer you the price cut. For example, if you run an Airbnb, you can reasonably claim to be in the hospitality business, which might qualify you for a discount. And contractors often have access to discounts that most people don&rsquo;t get, and they may be willing to extend them to you if you simply ask nicely&mdash;which could be as easy as letting you use their license info to get a price break at a big box hardware store, or using a contractor&rsquo;s name at a vendor.</p><p>Contractors aren&rsquo;t obligated to do so, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to ask&mdash;and a few percentage points off the price here and there can add up into significant savings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Fully Customize Your iPhone Notifications</title>

      <description>Make sure you only get pinged when you want to be.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone notifications are a constant accompaniment to everyday life&mdash;from texts and calls to breaking news and messages from your smart video doorbell&mdash;and to avoid non-stop distractions, you need to figure out the best way to configure the notification controls your phone gives you.</p><p>We've already covered <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/customize-notifications-on-android-phone" target="_blank">customizing notifications on Android</a>, and the iPhone also gives you plenty of control over the pings and buzzes you hear. In fact, there are more options for alerts in iOS than you might have realized if you haven't dug deeply into the settings&mdash;so you'll find a full rundown below.</p><p>While they're not talked about in this particular guide, remember that individual apps&mdash;like WhatsApp, Slack, and Instagram&mdash;have their own notification settings inside the apps themselves. You can use these to further fine-tune how notifications appear on your phone (Slack, for example, lets you pause alerts during certain times of the day).</p><h2 id="the-basics-of-sound-and-haptics">The basics of sound and haptics</h2><p>To start at the start, if you choose <strong>Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong> from the main iPhone Settings menu, you can configure sounds and vibrations across the whole of iOS. You can set the ringtone and notification volume from here, and set alert sounds for key events like calls, texts, voicemails, reminders, and emails. If you don't want a specific alert to make a sound, tap the alert and choose <strong>None</strong>.</p><p>If you have a newer iPhone with an Action Button, you'll see a <strong>Silent Mode</strong> toggle switch at the top&mdash;silent mode can also be launched <a href="https://lifehacker.com/everything-you-can-do-with-iphone-15-pros-action-button-1850832992" target="_blank">with the Action Button</a>, and via the Ring/Silent slider on older iPhones without an Action Button. With silent mode enabled, none of your incoming notifications will make a sound, though they will trigger vibrations.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737377612.jpg" alt="iPhone Silent Mode" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1737377612.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1737377612.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737377612.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Your iPhone comes with a Silent Mode setting.</span>
                                        <span class="text-xs inline-block text-gray-600">Credit: Lifehacker</span>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>If you'd rather not have the vibrations either&mdash;and want a completely quiet phone you can ignore until you're ready to look at it&mdash;tap <strong>Haptics</strong>. The next menu lets you choose if vibrations always play alongside notifications, only play in silent mode, only play out of silent mode, or never play.</p><p>The settings here don't affect what you see on screen: Visually, the notifications appear as normal, so if you're looking at your iPhone, you'll see them. If you come back to your phone after a break, they'll be waiting for you. However, the sounds and haptics options do give you a quick and easy way of making notifications less distracting across the board.</p><h2 id="setting-app-notification-options">Setting app notification options</h2><p>In addition to everything you can do via the <strong>Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong> menu in Settings, you can make changes to notifications from individual apps from the <strong>Notifications</strong> menu, also in Settings. At the top, you can set how you want them to work in general, whether you want them stacked or listed, or summarized with Apple Intelligence, for example.</p><p>Scroll down and you get to a full list of all the apps installed on your iPhone. Tap through on an app to customize its notifications, or to turn them off entirely: You can choose whether or not the alerts show up on the lock screen, in the Notification Center, and as banners at the top of the screen, as well as control grouping and preview behavior.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737377612.jpg" alt="iPhone notifications" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1737377612.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1737377612.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737377612.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>On some apps (including Messages and FaceTime) you can choose a specific notification sound to use, and for every app, you can have sounds enabled or disabled (as far as vibrations go, apps will follow the rules from the sounds and haptics settings). You can also set whether banner alerts are temporary or persistent.</p><p>These settings control not just the sounds that notifications make, but whether they turn up at all: If you turn off notifications for an app, you won't be disturbed by it, but you'll need to go into that app to be able to see if there's anything new there. You'll need to strike a balance between avoiding distractions and staying informed.</p><h2 id="using-focus-modes-on-the-iphone">Using Focus modes on the iPhone</h2><p>There's another layer to iPhone notifications: focus modes. These modes act like Do Not Disturb with extras, and let you have different settings for notifications at different times of the day. You could silence all social media messaging apps while you're at work, for example, and silence work-related apps while you're at home.</p><p>Head to <strong>Focus</strong> from Settings to see what's available. Even if you've never used the Focus feature before, you'll see several modes already created for you&mdash;for when you're driving, when you're sleeping, or when you're working out, for example. You also have the option, via the Share Across Devices toggle switch, to sync Focus modes between Apple devices (including Macs and Apple Watches).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737377612.jpg" alt="iPhone Do Not Disturb" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1737377612.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1737377612.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JJ1WD0RMCGG1R0CR2J4RSYVC/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737377612.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Tap on any Focus mode to make changes, or create a new one from scratch via the <strong>+</strong> (plus) button up in the top right corner. You've got plenty of options to explore here: Focus modes can be set to work on a schedule or enabled manually, and you get to choose which apps and contacts can still make your phone buzz and ping while in this mode. You can even have customized home screens and lock screens for each mode.</p><p>Note that these modes hide notifications away&mdash;they aren't queued up to be delivered later (which is what happens when your phone is in airplane mode). You'll need to head to the Notification Center or individual apps afterward to see if there's anything you've missed while notifications were silenced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 Are the Best Bone Conduction Headphones I've Tried</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHRA3FBF2C2Q9323JAYSFCGW</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>There's a separate speaker for bass, and virtually no annoying vibration.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHRA3FBF2C2Q9323JAYSFCGW/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>When I first learned about bone conduction headphones (BCH) I was mostly just curious&mdash;what would wearing them feel like? To me, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-bone-conduction-headphones-work" target="_blank">sending vibrations through the head to transmit audio</a> sounded like a technology out of a sci-fi book. It was anticlimactic, to say the least, when I got my hands on my first pair. None of my sci-fi fantasies came true&mdash;the audio experience is lacking compared to traditional in-air or on-ear headphones&mdash;but the experience is still pretty novel.</p><p>Yes, the technology is still relatively new when it comes to headphones, and device-makers are still experimenting with how to make the best use of it. The primary advantage of BCH is clear, however: They don't cover your ears, so you retain complete spatial awareness when wearing them. I've since tested a number of styles and brands of these headphones, but none from Shokz, one of the biggest names in the space. So when the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXJbd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Shokz%20OpenRun%20Pro%202&amp;short_url=QxXJbd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a> came out in December, I decided to see how they stack up. </p><p>After using them for many runs, workouts, bike rides, calls, and podcasts, I can easily recommend these headphones to anyone who needs headphones that allow them to hear their surroundings when out and about without sacrificing too much on audio quality. I don't recommend them if you're looking for true audio fidelity (traditional headphones will always sound better), need to use them in loud environments (like a very noisy gym), or are looking for headphones to use underwater (I recommend the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6ogAl?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=OpenSwim%20Pro&amp;short_url=z6ogAl&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">OpenSwim Pro</a> instead). </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<h3>Comfort</h3><p>The OpenRun Pro 2 feel like premium headphones. They are light but durable. The silicone coating feels comfortable against the skin and they are extremely light, their 1.02 ounces evenly distributed so you barely know they're there. </p><p>Shokz offers two sizes, a "Standard" and a "<a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4bNM?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Mini&amp;short_url=zj4bNM&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Mini</a>" option along with a <a href="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0074/1890/4612/files/Find_your_size_EN.pdf?v=1650011092" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">sizing guide</a> that I found very helpful to see which is the right fit for me. I often find BCH headphones feel too big for me: The back end sags, lifting the front end and making the experience of wearing them frustrating. However, the standard size Open Run 2 felt custom-made for me, with a snug fit that made them impossible to shake off. They are easy to put on and forget about, which is the best thing I can say about any pair of headphones. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>Battery life</h3><p>Shokz claims you get 12 hours of listening, which seemed accurate based on my testing. These headphones use a USB-C charger, which is a big change from the previous model, which had a pretty unique <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6ogmY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=charging%20cable&amp;short_url=z6ogmY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">charging cable</a>. With USB-C charging,Shokz joins the rest of the tech world with a more universal, fast-charging option. </p><p>The physical buttons to control the media are a plus, given these are headphones are tailored for working out and being outdoors (touch controls tend go haywire the second moisture enters the picture). Power and volume controls sit behind the right ear and are easy to find and press even while running.  On the left side you'll find the "play/pause" button. Unlike other BCH headsets I've tried, it is intelligently placed in a spot where you can put pressure, so you can press it with one finger instead of having to pinch it with two.  </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="shokz-openrun-pro-2-are-a-bone-conductionearbud-hybrid">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are a bone conduction/earbud hybrid </h2><p>Remember how I said companies are still experimenting with BCH technology? Shokz is trying out an interesting new mix of features with the OpenRun Pro 2. They call it DualPitch technology, and it mixes bone conduction technology with old-school earbud tech that pumps sound through the air. The OpenRun Pro 2 adds an extra 18-by-11-millimeter speaker designed for low-frequency sounds, which addresses one of the biggest complaints about BCH headsets: weak bass. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>Bigger, smoother bass</h3><p>Better bass does a lot to improve overall audio quality, even if it the end result still can't match traditional headphones. Anyone who has given up on BCH because of their lack of bass should at least give the OpenRun Pro 2 a chance&mdash;though keep in mind that the bass is good <em>for BCH headphones,</em> but  still on the weaker end when compared to regular headphones (the bass on BCH headsets will never reach the levels of, say, the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/my-favorite-amazon-deal-of-the-day-skullcandy-crusher-anc-2" target="_blank">Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2</a>). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Perhaps an unintended consequence of the DualPitch technology is the elimination of another con of BCH&mdash; that annoying rattling vibration that tickles my ears when playing music at a higher volume, or when certain pitches are hit. While using the OpenRun Pro 2, I never felt that irritating sensation, even when I cracked them way up (with a single exception that I'll address later). Typically bass is the main culprit causing that unpleasant ticklish sensation, but since this set pumps that additional bass through the air via the extra drivers instead of through your skull, that sensation is gone.</p><h3>A little leaky, a little too quiet</h3><p>BCH headphones tend to leak a bit, as do open-ear headphones. Given these headphones use both of those technologies, that's definitely an occasional issue here. Sitting next to my fiancee while we work from home while listening at 45% volume, she's able to tell exactly what song I am playing (though to be fair, 45% volume is on the higher end in a quiet environment). </p><p>Conversely, I felt the volume wasn't loud enough in noisy environments. When taking these for a workout in my local gym, the gym's speakers easily overpowered my headphones, creating a chaotic mush of sounds. (They worked better in this environment for listening to podcasts or audiobooks, however.) While using them on a run, I could hear the music, but I wasn't feeling it like I would with regular earbuds because of the noise around me and the limited volume.

<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how well these headphones picked up my voice over while outdoors. The mic uses an AI to isolate your voice and eliminate background noise, which is helpful while running or biking. I was able to have a regular conversation, despite a lot of wind and background noise. I did have some occasional trouble hearing the other person, which goes hand-in-hand with the volume limitations that I mentioned earlier. Even when testing them in a the quiet environment of my office, sound is a bit muffed, but still clear enough.</p><h3>A versatile connection option</h3><p>I love that Shokz includes MultiPoint, allowing me to switch between two devices seamlessly, like my phone and computer. This makes the headphones more versatile, and a great option for working from home, considering I am able to hear my phone, dog, the door, other people, or anything that happens around me while using them, and switching back and forth between my phone and laptop. Unfortunately, since they're only rated <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/dust-resistant-waterproof-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings" target="_self" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>IP55</u></a> for water resistance, I can't take them with me in the shower, or I would probably never take these headphones off.</p><h2 id="the-shokz-app">The Shokz app</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are among the best BCH you can get right now, with impressive audio and call quality, making them an excellent choice for those looking to hear their surroundings while out and about. They also make surprisingly good headphones for working from home thanks to the MultiPoint connectivity, naturally open ear design, and good audio quality relatively speaking. These headphones won't be a good match for those looking for headphones to work in loud environments or those hoping to swim or shower with them. </p><p>The bass is the best I've heard in bone conduction headphones, with no rattling that tickles your ears. They serve their purpose well, but are also pricey at $179.99. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Champurrado Is My New Favorite Hot Cocoa, and It Takes Just Four Ingredients to Make</title>

      <description>This hot chocolate drink uses masa harina to add thickness and plenty of flavor.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Champurrado is a thick and creamy hot beverage whose major flavor and thickening ingredient is masa harina, nixtamalized corn flour. This Mexican staple is sweet, comforting, completely satisfying, and relatively simple to make with just a few ingredients and a whisk. If you haven&rsquo;t come across it yet, allow me to introduce you to this winter beverage that drinks like a meal.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-is-champurrado">What is champurrado?</h2><p>Champurrado is also called an atole, which is any masa-based beverage&mdash;but champurrado specifically is enjoyed sweetened with sugar, and flavored with chocolate, cinnamon, or other seasonings. You might think, like other hot chocolates out there, that the cocoa would be the flavor diva in this drink, but masa harina is the unexpected star here. It's rather well known as a special kind of finely ground corn flour used to make the dough for recipes like tortillas, pupusas, or tamales, but perhaps less often touted for its role in a satisfying hot drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Unlike wheat flour, masa harina doesn&rsquo;t contain gluten, so mixing it into water or milk doesn&rsquo;t cause rubbery strands or clumps of gluten to develop. The corn flour disperses easily&mdash;not to say that you can&rsquo;t get lumps, but more tips on preventing that below. The starches absorb the available liquid and create a thick, spoonable, almost pudding-like consistency when heated (which you can control with more or less water). The drink boasts the nutty, earthy flavors of corn, and once you add sugar and chocolate to that, you have yourself an undeniable morning treat.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-to-make-champurrado">How to make champurrado</h2><p>This Mexican staple requires only four ingredients, but you can get a bit fancy with the flavors if you&rsquo;d like to add a pinch of salt, a dash of cinnamon, or a star anise pod. I truly recommend using chopped panela, also called piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar), as your sweetener because the flavor is so lovely, but you can use brown sugar if that&rsquo;s what you have access to. Likewise, Mexican chocolate has its own subtly spiced flavor profile, but if you can&rsquo;t find it then you can substitute a broken up semi-sweet chocolate bar, or omit it and simply make a cinnamon atole.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>To ensure the smoothest possible consistency, be sure to whisk frequently, especially in the beginning when it thickens quickly. You can also run an immersion blender through the mixture at the end which has two benefits: aeration and smoothing out any lumps.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a second and taste your champurrado before serving. I use Abuelita chocolate here which includes sugar, so depending on the chocolate you use, you may end up adding more or less panela than I have. Ditto that with adjusting the thickness to your own personal preference. I prefer drinking it thin, but if its a good day and I have cookies on hand (like today) then I enjoy dipping them in a thicker champurrado.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

      <description>If you see any of these signs, you might be caught up in a criminal investigation.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJY8PSM5P4CTQNVD8RZBAQX/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the fact that there are <a href="https://www.ncsc.org/newsroom/at-the-center/2024/court-statistics-project-releases-trial-court-caseload-trends" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">more than 15 million active criminal cases</a> every year, most Americans are only familiar with criminal investigations by the police through television shows. Police dramas are fun, but they make the investigation process seem pretty straightforward and obvious&mdash;those under investigation know about it immediately, and the case is usually wrapped up pretty quickly.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/things-real-cops-will-never-ask-you-to-do" target="_blank">The reality</a> is very different: Criminal investigations can take a very long time, and people can be swept up in one without their knowledge. The police are under no obligation to inform you when they investigate you. Whether you&rsquo;re suspected of crimes directly or you&rsquo;re associated with someone else being investigated, there are signs you can spot that indicate the cops are looking at you. Even if you&rsquo;re innocent of any crime, knowing that you&rsquo;re under investigation means you can take steps to protect yourself, like consulting a lawyer and being cognizant of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-you-should-and-shouldn-t-talk-to-the-police-acc-1849398161" target="_blank">your rights</a> against improper searches of your property. Here are the clues that you might be under investigation by the cops.</p><h2 id="subtle-signs-youre-being-investigated">Subtle signs you're being investigated </h2><p>Some of the signs that the police are investigating you are easy to overlook, and difficult to pin down. If you notice the following things happening around you, you might be under investigation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unknown vehicles.</strong> Are there unfamiliar vehicles parked near your home or work? Seeing the same strange cars or other vehicles repeatedly parked nearby could be a sign of surveillance&mdash;either by cops or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/signs-thieves-casing-house" target="_blank">thieves</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other signs of surveillance.</strong> If you notice cameras&mdash;either carried by people who mysteriously show up wherever you are or suddenly installed on your street&mdash;the police may be recording your movements and behavior as part of an investigation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trackers.</strong> A GPS tracker on your car might have been <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-tell-if-cops-put-gps-tracker-on-your-car-and-what-to-do-next" target="_blank">placed by the police</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Odd social media contacts.</strong> If you notice a clump of new followers or connection requests from people you don&rsquo;t know, or notice a spike in traffic or followers with no easy explanation, it might be investigators monitoring your online activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Associates arrested or investigated.</strong> If people you have a connection to are charged with crimes or are being openly investigated, it&rsquo;s very possible your name will at least come up as part of that investigation. If people around you are being targeted by the cops one by one, you might be caught up in it all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bank complications.</strong> If you start to have a lot of trouble making normal, everyday financial transactions and your bank or other financial institutions can&rsquo;t explain or resolve the problem, it might be a sign that your finances are being monitored.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hesitation to associate.</strong> Are friends and business associates suddenly unavailable and/or reluctant to talk to you? It might indicate that the police have questioned them about you, prompting them to distance themselves.</p></li></ul><p>These signs are tough to spot, and difficult to interpret, but seeing more than one in your life should prompt at least the suspicion that you&rsquo;re being investigated. There are other, more obvious signs, too.</p><h2 id="overt-signs-youre-being-investigated">Overt signs you're being investigated </h2><p>While the police often investigate in the background without alerting the subjects, there are some very obvious signs that you&rsquo;re under investigation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Direct contact.</strong> The police may not tell you directly that you&rsquo;re under investigation even if they bring you to the police station or their offices for questioning, or contact you directly in other ways. But they don&rsquo;t have to tell you why they want to talk to you, so it&rsquo;s best to assume that if they&rsquo;re asking you questions it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re the subject of an investigation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Associates interviewed.</strong> Similarly, if the police are questioning your acquaintances or business associates, it&rsquo;s a clear sign that you might be under investigation&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re the common denominator between disparate people.</p></li><li><p><strong>ISP subpoena letter.</strong> If your internet service provider (ISP) receives a subpoena to provide information about your online activity, they are required to send you a letter notifying you of the request and their compliance. If you get a letter like that, it could be linked to a lawsuit, but it could also be the police investigating you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Frozen accounts.</strong> If your finances go from wonky to literally frozen so you can&rsquo;t access any of your money, it&rsquo;s often due to a criminal investigation that leads in some way to your finances. If your credit cards and bank account are suddenly inaccessible, you&rsquo;ve probably been under investigation for some time.</p></li></ul><h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-think-youre-being-investigated">What to do if you think you're being investigated </h2><p>If you think you&rsquo;re seeing signs that the cops are investigating you, there are a few fundamental steps to take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lawyer up. </strong>Whether you&rsquo;re innocent or guilty&mdash;and even if you have no idea why you might be the target of a police investigation&mdash;you should immediately consult an attorney regarding your suspicions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shut up.</strong> You have a right not to incriminate yourself, and you are never under any obligation to speak with police without an attorney present. Don&rsquo;t contact the police to ask if you&rsquo;re being investigated&mdash;they don&rsquo;t have to tell you, and anything you say could be used against you. If you&rsquo;re contacted by law enforcement, say nothing and direct them to your lawyers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lock up.</strong> The police are required to obtain a warrant to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-to-do-and-not-do-when-a-cop-knocks-on-your-door-1848980595" target="_blank">search your property</a>. In the absence of one, don&rsquo;t allow law enforcement to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-to-do-if-the-police-raid-your-house-1849390605" target="_blank">enter your home</a> or business.<br><br></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

The feature aims to make sorting through the pings on your Lock Screen a neater, faster experience, by grouping multiple notifications from the same app together and quickly summarizing the lot. Unfortunately, it seems the feature isn&rsquo;t quite ready yet, seeing as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge93de21n0o" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>the BBC</u> complained to Apple</a> that Notification Summaries made up false headlines for its news stories. Now, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/whats-new-ios-183" target="_blank">with iOS 18.3 beta 3</a>, Apple is rolling back how involved the feature is, and is making it easier to opt out of entirely.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="no-ai-summaries-for-news-apps">No AI summaries for news apps</h2><p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a response to reporting like the BBC&rsquo;s, or perhaps it&rsquo;s a coincidence, but the biggest change to Notification Summaries in the latest iOS 18.3 beta is that they&rsquo;re being paused for news and entertainment apps. If you try to enable notification summaries for a news app, iOS will tell you the setting is &ldquo;temporarily unavailable,&rdquo; although you can still turn it on to start receiving summaries when they&rsquo;re re-enabled.</p><p>Given that Notification Summaries had previously sent users what looked like an official BBC alert that United Healthcare shooting suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself when the paper only mentioned an &ldquo;angry outburst,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s probably for the best.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

To install the current iOS 18.3 beta, first <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-download-ios-18-on-iphone" target="_blank"><u>ensure you have a compatible phone</u></a>, then double-check that you&rsquo;ve enrolled your iPhone into Apple&rsquo;s beta program at <a href="http://beta.apple.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>beta.apple.com</u></a>. From here, simply open your iPhone and navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> <strong>&gt; Beta Updates</strong>. If you&rsquo;re also enrolled in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>developer beta program</u></a> (you don&rsquo;t need to be in this instance), you&rsquo;ll be able to choose between <strong>iOS 18 Developer Beta</strong> or <strong>iOS 18 Public Beta</strong> here, but either will work if you only see one. Make your selection, then tap <strong>Back</strong> and download <strong>iOS 18.3 Beta 3</strong> when it pops up on your screen.</p><p>Note that beta releases tend to be buggier than final builds, so download this update to your main device at your own risk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Four Ways to Turn a Hallway Into a Useful Room</title>

      <description>If you’re desperate for more useful space in your home, your hallways could be doing more.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHTNCNFHAVKZVHYWK2486J3E/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the day you moved into your home, you may have wondered how you'd ever fill all that space. Flash forward a few years and suddenly you're wracking your brain trying to carve out an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/my-favorite-storage-solutions-for-any-dorm-or-small-liv-1850695911" target="_blank">extra storage area</a>, or contemplating a major remodel to add <a href="https://lifehacker.com/cheap-ways-to-add-square-footage-to-your-house-1850728905" target="_blank">more square footage</a>.</p><p>If this sounds like you and you&rsquo;re all out of ideas, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; resource lurking in your house: the hallways. Depending on how wide yours are (the minimum width, according to the International Residential Code, is <a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/s/IRC2015/part-iii-building-planning-and-construction/IRC2015-Pt03-Ch03-SecR311.6" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">36 inches</a>, but most residential hallways are 42-48 inches wide, and some homes even have 60- or 72-inch hallways!), you could be putting them to better use than as a mere conduit from one room to another.</p><p>If your hallways are a cramped three feet wide, it will be difficult to make them pull double duty. But if your hallways are at least four feet wide, you have options to turn them into surprisingly useful rooms.</p><h2 id="use-a-hallways-as-a-dining-room">Use a hallways as a dining room</h2><p>If you have a relatively wide hallway off the kitchen and you need a place to eat that isn&rsquo;t standing over the sink or balancing plates on your knees, you can turn that space into a quasi-dining room with a little creativity. With four feet of space to work with, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/924XpD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=narrow%20dining%20table%20like%20this%20one%2C&amp;short_url=924XpD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">narrow dining table like this one,</a> pushed up against one wall, can work&mdash;at just under 16 inches wide, it leaves plenty of space for people to sit, and the chairs slide underneath when not in use. Hang some lighting over the table and install some shelving for storage and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a small but usable dining room. If you're tighter on space, you could even consider a drop-leaf table that would fold flat against the wall when not in use.</p><h2 id="set-up-a-hallway-library">Set up a hallway library</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to make a hallway function as a room is to turn it into a library or other shelf-focused storage area. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXV0R?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Shallow%20bookcases%20like%20these&amp;short_url=9wXV0R&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Shallow bookcases like these</a> (less than 10 inches deep) can make even a three foot hallway a viable library option. Adding narrow seating (like this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbr0p?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=entryway%20bench&amp;short_url=aAbr0p&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">entryway bench</a>) against the wall between two of the bookcases, plus some wall-mounted lighting, can make that hallway feel like a cozy reading spot.</p><h2 id="use-a-hallway-as-a-conversation-area">Use a hallway as a conversation area</h2><p>Hallways are usually hurried through, but if you lack a space in your house to sit with a friend and chat, your hallway might offer an opportunity. If your hallway is at least four feet wide, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjvN4?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=shallow%20bench%20with%20a%20back&amp;short_url=zEjvN4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">shallow bench with a back</a> along with a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YO45j?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=narrow%20side%20table&amp;short_url=9YO45j&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">narrow side table</a> carves a spot to sit with a cup of tea and chat with a neighbor, or to hang out and think without the distraction of a TV mounted directly in front of you.</p><h2 id="a-hallways-can-even-be-a-bedroom">A hallways can even be a "bedroom"</h2><p>No, your hallway will never be a real bedroom, even if it&rsquo;s a ludicrous six feet wide. But if it&rsquo;s at least four feet wide, it <em>can</em> be a place where surprise and overflow guests can sleep when needed. One or two <a href="https://zdcs.link/924X6W?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=narrow%20twin%20bed%20frames&amp;short_url=924X6W&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">narrow twin bed frames</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrX04m?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=daybeds&amp;short_url=QrX04m&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">daybeds</a> can turn a wide hallway into a sleepover spot, and the daybed option doubles as seating for a conversation area or reading nook when not otherwise in use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When the AirPods Max came out in 2020, there wasn't as much competition for headphones that could achieve <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-noise-canceling-headphones" target="_blank">active noise-cancelling</a> (ANC), ambient awareness features, and provide <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-over-ear-headphones" target="_blank">top-tier audio as well</a>. These days, there's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-over-ear-headphones" target="_blank">stiff competition</a> in all of those categories, especially at this price point. However, buying AirPods Max is a <em>statement</em>. Even though they don't have the Apple logo, you're paying a premium price for the recognition. If that's what you're after, these headphones are it.</p><p>When it comes to features, the AirPods Max aren't jam-packed&mdash;but the few they do have are very good quality, which is on-brand for Apple's minimalist vibe. They are some of the best ANC headphones you can buy (they don't give you that weird pressure sensation when you turn them on), have very good ambient awareness to hear your surroundings well, have adaptive EQ and spatial audio, which adjusts the audio automatically to you and your environment, and hands-free Siri, according to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-airpods-max" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag's "excellent" review</a>. </p><p>Some of the downsides are that they are heavier than regular headphones at 13.6 ounces. This comes from the choice to use metal for the ear pieces. You also can't manually adjust the EQ to your liking, so if you don't like the sound signature, you're out of luck. Finally, the smart case it comes with is, well, ugly and doesn't protect the mesh that rests on your head (a delicate part of the headphones). You also need that smart case to put your headphones in "sleep" mode so your 20 hours of battery aren't drained.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What's Next Now That the Supreme Court Has Upheld the TikTok Ban</title>

      <description>With the Supreme Court upholding Congress' TikTok ban, here's what could be next for the hotly contested app.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHRD8X9V9SQD9KNXK3V0N9X4/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on TikTok over the past few days, you&rsquo;ve no doubt witnessed your favorite creators saying their goodbyes and telling you where you can find them next. With <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet" target="_blank">Congress' impending ban</a> on the social media app set to take effect in the U.S. on Sunday, it seems like there&rsquo;s little the platform&rsquo;s users can do. On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that it is upholding the ban, citing Congress' concerns over Chinese access to American user data&mdash;but that might not be the end of the story.</p><h2 id="the-supreme-court-upheld-the-tiktok-ban">The Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban</h2><p>In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-656_ca7d.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">per curiam opinion</a> posted Friday morning, the Supreme Court decided to uphold the TikTok ban that's set to remove the platform from app stores starting Sunday, Jan. 19. The move marks the heaviest blow yet to the hope that the app could continue operating as usual, but despite acknowledging that "TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression" for "more than 170 million Americans," the Court ultimately decided to stand by Congress' "well-supported national security concerns."</p><p>However, the opinion did offer one silver lining for users as they flee to other apps. While acknowledging that TikTok represents "new technologies with transformative capabilities," the court cautioned that its ruling should be "understood to be narrowly focused," rather than serving as precedent for future cases. The justices also argued that their reasoning is "content neutral," attempting to ease concerns that the real reason behind the TikTok ban might be what users are seeing rather than how their data is being handled.</p><h2 id="will-tiktok-shut-down">Will TikTok shut down?</h2><p>Technically, the terms of TikTok's ban don't require the site to shut down operation in the U.S., but rather keeps its app from being distributed by app stores. In this state, new users couldn't download the app, while it would slowly become unusable over time for everyone else. Overall, then, the loss of the platform would be a more gradual transition. However, reports say that TikTok is willing to go a step further, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-preparing-us-shut-off-sunday-information-reports-2025-01-15/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>threatening to shut down altogether</u></a> as a sort of nuclear option to protest the ban now that it's been upheld. (It's also been pumping up its alternative video app <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apps-bytedance-operates-in-united-states" target="_blank">Lemon8</a>, although the TikTok ban would presumably affect this platform as well.)</p><p>The idea, it seems, is to play chicken with the government. American users have already shown their willingness to use similar <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-rednote-or-xiaohongshu" target="_blank">Chinese app Xiaohongshu</a> (or RedNote) as a replacement-for-TikTok-slash-act-of-protest, and TikTok users in particular have been quick to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/rather-go-to-china-than-to-use-instagram-reels" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">shut down the possibility of moving to Instagram reels</a> or other American alternatives. In taking the app away from these users entirely, TikTok might be able to spur them into political action (don't be surprised if opening the TikTok app on Sunday prompts you to call your representatives).</p><p>Essentially, TikTok parent company Bytedance seemingly doesn't seem willing to sell to an American company, which is the only way the current ban would allow TikTok to keep operating. Overcoming the Supreme Court is a tough job, but in swaying public opinion towards its side, the company seems to be looking to do just that.</p><p>In fact, it's already seen some success, as key government officials across both aisles have already expressed desire to backpedal on Congress' legislation.</p><h2 id="biden-leaving-enforcing-the-ban-up-to-a-tiktok-friendly-trump">Biden leaving enforcing the ban up to a TikTok-friendly Trump </h2><p>Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-keep-tiktok-available-us-rcna187902" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">reports</a> were <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-administration-leave-trump-implement-tiktok-ban/story?id=117753133" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">split</a> on whether Biden would take any steps to circumvent the ban. Now, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/17/statement-by-white-house-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-regarding-tiktok/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">White House</a> has issued an official statement that it is leaving responsibility for enforcing the ban to incoming President Donald Trump.</p><p>"Given the sheer fact of timing," the statement reads, acknowledging the unusual position the ban's implementation places on Biden's White House a day before he leaves office, "this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration."</p><p>The statement also reiterated Biden's opinion that TikTok should remain available but under American ownership. However, in leaving responsibility for enforcing the ban up to President Trump, it does seem to give the incoming administration free reign to decide how the law is actually implemented&mdash;it's possible (though unlikely) that TikTok could even continue to be distributed on Sunday without retribution.</p><p>It's perhaps good news for TikTok users, then, that President Trump has already <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-ban-congress-president-282d8df7b91dce270316509badd39978" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">vocally expressed his opposition to the ban</a>, and reports indicate he's ready to act to stop it. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/15/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Washington Post</u></a> says Trump is considering penning an executive order that would delay the ban&rsquo;s enforcement by 60 to 90 days. Even with Biden's blessing to decide what to do next, such an extreme measure would perhaps be Trump&rsquo;s only play here, as the ban is still legally set to go into effect one day before he takes office. Trump's stance marks a similar change in attitude to President Biden's: during his first term, Trump signed an <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>executive order</u></a> that attempted to force TikTok to shut down operations in the U.S., something the company avoided by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tiktoks-answer-to-security-concerns-grant-oracle-full-source-code-access" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>partnering with U.S.-based company Oracle</u></a> to protect the data of American users.</p><h2 id="a-last-ditch-bill-to-save-tiktok-for-now">A last ditch bill to save TikTok (for now)</h2><p>Realistically, the most stable way to get the ban struck down would be for the members of Congress who voted for it to change their minds. The biggest governmental backpedal we&rsquo;ve seen on the TikTok ban so far&mdash;or at least the biggest one that doesn&rsquo;t rely on hearsay and anonymous sources&mdash;would be a <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-to-introduce-bill-to-extend-deadline-for-tiktok-ban-takes-to-senate-floor-in-support-of-vibrant-online-communities" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>new bill from Democratic Senator Ed Markey</u></a>. Introduced this week, Markey's bill would have extended the deadline for the ban by 270 days, giving TikTok more time to find a buyer or provide lawmakers an opportunity to reevaluate the situation. Unfortunately, it was <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/01/16/dc/tiktok-trump/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">quickly struck down by Republican lawmakers</a>, but the reasoning behind it does show that at least parts of Congress are beginning to waver.</p><p>&ldquo;In four days, TikTok goes dark,&rdquo; Markey said while introducing the legislation. &ldquo;My bill just says, we need more time.&rdquo;</p><p>As part of his justification for the bill, Markey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH6E8WaGHcw" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>argued</u></a> that TikTok has been &ldquo;central to our economy and the way in which we communicate,&rdquo; arguing that the communities its creators and small businesses have established there &ldquo;cannot be replicated on another app.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We need time to have a deeper conversation about how to address the national security risks caused by Bytedance&rsquo;s ownership of TikTok.&rdquo; Markey continued. &ldquo;We need time to understand the ban&rsquo;s implication on TikTok&rsquo;s creators and users. We need time to consider alternative ideas.&rdquo;</p><p>This bill also marked something of a change in attitude from Markey, who originally spoke out against banning the platform but nonetheless <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/04/23/senate-vote-tiktok-ban-ukraine-israel-aid/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>voted for the current ban</u></a>&mdash;although it should be noted that the ban was included in a bill also providing aid to Ukraine and Israel.&nbsp;</p><p>For his part, in a post on X, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to <a href="https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1879983146986361115" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">continue "working to keep TikTok alive,"</a> even in the face of Republican opposition.</p><h2 id="support-for-the-ban-remains">Support for the ban remains</h2><p>While politicians across both aisles and two branches of government have now spoken about reversing or delaying the ban, some in government are sticking to their original decision.</p><p>&ldquo;They had all the time in the world,&rdquo; Republican Senator Rick Scott said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had an opportunity to sell it to make sure the Chinese government doesn&rsquo;t control it and they decided not to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who led the charge on blocking Markey's bill, said, "We didn't pull the rug out from under TikTok, and we didn't ban it. Instead, Congress simply demanded that the app could no longer be owned and controlled by our nation's worst enemy, communist China."</p><p>For now, all eyes are on Trump, who takes office on Monday. Hopeful viewers include even TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who will be present at Trump's inauguration and has already <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/7460937381265411370" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">posted a video</a> preemptively thanking Trump "for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States." This kind of signaling could just be wishful thinking, or it could indicate that while there's little Trump can do to keep the ban from going into effect on Sunday, we could see some quick action just one day later. As Trump told CNN shortly after the Supreme Court's decision went through, "It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do."</p><p>But even if legal pressure from the highest office in the land fails to bring back your favorite influencers, there's also the question of public opinion. Depending on how TikTok responds to the Supreme Court's decision, Americans could have a very different response to the ban. With enough public fervor, it's possible we'll see more attempts from either Congress or the presidency to keep this saga from being finished quite yet. </p><p><em>Update 4:30 PM ET: Updated this post with a video from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It finally happened: <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-ban-news" target="_blank">Following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling against it</a>, TikTok was legally banned in the United States on Jan. 19. In response, TikTok pulled <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apps-bytedance-operates-in-united-states" target="_blank">all of its apps</a> from U.S. app stores, including popular apps like CapCut and Lemon8, before going dark. If you were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/business/china-tiktok-house-bill.html#:~:text=TikTok%20wields%20wide%20influence%20in,billion%20users%20across%20140%20countries." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">one of the 170 million Americans</a> who use TikTok every day, you might've be a bit upset by the situation. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-happens-after-tiktok-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">You might have even flocked to another Chinese-based app</a>, like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-rednote-or-xiaohongshu" target="_blank">RedNote</a>.</p><p>Just hours after blocking access for U.S. users, however, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-executive-order-tiktok-ban" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TikTok returned</a>. The app is working again, and now displays a message thanking President-elect Trump for his "efforts," ignoring Trump originally wanted to ban the app too when he was president. Trump posted on Truth Social earlier in the day, pledging to sign an executive order to extend TikTok's deadline and work towards a situation where an American company has a 50% share in TikTok. Trump isn't President as of this article, so we'll see where the situation goes from here, but as of now, TikTok is working again. </p><p>That doesn't mean the app is saved for good. As the law stands, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, must divest its ownership, or face a legal ban in the U.S. If the app <em>is</em> eventually banned in this country, however, that won't totally stop you from being able to access it. Sure, it might make it much more difficult to access, but you can keep scrolling on Jan. 19 just as you had the day before&mdash;at least, for a while.</p><h2 id="why-did-the-us-ban-tiktok">Why did the U.S. ban TikTok?</h2><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here" target="_blank">We've broken the situation down in our explainer here</a>, but here's a brief summary. The U.S. has long had concerns about TikTok, going back to the first Trump Administration. The issue is largely based around national security: TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese-based company, that must comply with Chinese law. As such, there are concerns that ByteDance could hand the Chinese government data on the platform's millions of American users, as well as manipulate the infamously addictively algorithm to control what content Americans specifically see.</p><p>It's not necessarily the app itself that Congress and the President are focused on: It's the Chinese government. That's why the "ban" is only part of the law President Biden signed back in April. The language gave ByteDance nine months to find an American-based buyer for TikTok in the U.S. If it had, ByteDance could have divested its stake in TikTok, and the app could have continued to without interruption. The company decided not to do that, however, insisting TikTok (and its proprietary algorithm) was not for sale. So, here we are.</p><p>This situation has been wild, and there's no telling exactly where we go from here. Should the app go dark again, however, you will have some control over your ability to access TikTok in a post-ban American. Here's how:</p><h2 id="make-sure-you-have-tiktok-on-your-phone">Make sure you have TikTok on your phone</h2><p>As we saw with the original ban, once the app is barred, companies like Apple and Google will remove TikTok from their app stores in the U.S. When that happens, the app will no longer be available to download through official channels: If you try to search for TikTok on the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, you'll probably just find a bunch of similar social media apps, or apps built for TikTok&mdash;not TikTok itself.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not surprising: It wouldn't be much of a ban if the government couldn't force companies to remove apps from their marketplaces. However, while the forces at be can ensure apps like TikTok are barred from app stores, they can't actually remove apps from your device itself. If you already have TikTok on your iPhone or Android device, it's staying there&mdash;until you delete it yourself.</p><p>If you already have TikTok on your phone, great. If not, and you want to make sure you can keep using the app after a potential ban, download it at your earliest convenience. (As of this writing, TikTok still isn't back on U.S. app stores.) Once it is back, here are some links to various marketplaces to get you started:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok/id835599320" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">iOS App Store</a> (also available on iPadOS, iMessage, and visionOS)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/musical-ly-Inc-TikTok/dp/B0117U0G3M" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Amazon Appstore</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nh2gph4jzs4?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="sideload-tiktok-android-only">Sideload TikTok (Android only)</h2><p>After a ban, TikTok will be off the app stores in the U.S., but if you forgot to download the app before the ban, don't worry: You can still download it&mdash;at least on Android. </p><p>Unlike iOS (in the United States, anyway), Android allows you to sideload apps, or, in other words, install apps from unofficial sources. This has long been a perk of Android over iOS, and although <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-175-brings-iphone-sideloading-to-the-eu" target="_blank">Apple has opened up sideloading for users in the EU</a>, it remains Android-only for most of the world. As such, if you really wanted to, you could download the latest version of TikTok to your Android device even if it is no longer available on the Play Store. </p><p>You'll want to be careful here, though: Sideloading offers few protections that the app you're installing is legit. That's why it's always better to go through official channels when possible. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/necro-trojan-malware-has-infected-11-million-android-devices" target="_blank">Google doesn't always catch the malicious apps</a>, but it does find a <em>lot</em> of them. Going rogue, you run certain risks, especially since the world will know that Android users in the U.S. are looking for unofficial TikTok downloads. </p><p>If you do go down this path, <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/?post_type=app_release&amp;searchtype=apk&amp;s=tiktok" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">use APKMirror</a> rather than a cursory Google search. The site is trusted, and is a popular destination for sideloading. Just make sure to download TikTok itself, and not one of the other variations of the app that you might see in a search.</p><h2 id="get-a-vpn">Get a VPN</h2><p>If you have TikTok on your phone, no one can take it from you. However, they can break it. Late Saturday night, TikTok blocked network access to the app for users in the U.S. You could still open TikTok, but instead of a login screen or your FYP, you were greeted by a message informing you why TikTok is banned in your country. </p><p>If it happens again, many (if not most), will likely continue on to American-based short form videos apps, but not you: Instead, you will be able to keep using TikTok, because you will have a VPN on your device.</p><p>A <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-a-vpn" target="_blank">VPN (virtual private network)</a> lets you access parts of the internet your country or government wouldn't otherwise permit. It works by encrypting your connection and routing it through servers outside your country. If the U.S. doesn't allow connections to TikTok, for example, a VPN could make it look like you're accessing the internet from, say, Romania. You can watch TikTok in Romania without issue, so if TikTok's servers think you're in the westernmost country in Europe, it'll connect you. Ban avoided.</p><p>There are a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-free-vpns" target="_blank">ton of VPNs</a> out there to choose from, but you don't need to get fancy (or even spend any money) to access TikTok post-ban. All you need is a VPN that actively routes your traffic to a country that hasn't banned the platform, as well as a service that will route traffic within apps&mdash;not just within your web browser. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s the tricky bit: Based on the first time the app went dark, it seems TikTok blocks access to any American account, regardless of whether you use a VPN or not. So even if the app thinks you are in Romania, if you are logging in with an account you made in the U.S., no TikTok for you. </p><p>You have a couple of options here: First, after setting up a VPN in another country, you could try creating a new account: TikTok will think this account is based in the country you&rsquo;re VPN is set to, and should let you in without issue. However, if TikTok recognizes your <em>app</em> is American, that could pose further issues. </p><p>If all else fails, what I was able to get to work was using TikTok in my browser with a VPN set to a specific country. For some reason, Japan didn&rsquo;t work, and I received an error message when trying to load TikTok. But when I switched my location to Romania, I was in&mdash;of course, with Romanian content pushed to the front page.</p><p>I was using Proton VPN to get this to work, which <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/review-of-proton-vpn-free-tier" target="_blank">has a great free tier</a>, and should work within the TikTok app on both iOS and Android. The only catch is you can&rsquo;t choose your country; it picks for you. So you might need to refresh your country a few times before you find one that works. In theory, though, any VPN should work, so long as your connection is routed through a country TikTok supports.</p><h2 id="dont-use-the-app-forever">Don't use the app forever</h2><p>Even if you get the app to work, you really shouldn't use it forever. </p><p>Here's the deal: TikTok is staying on your iPhone or Android if you installed it already. But if the developers are no longer supporting the app in the U.S., that means there will be no new features added for your app, nor any fixes for bugs that may appear. So, you might encounter some weird glitches or crashes the longer you use the app following the ban, and you won't see any of the changes that TikTok makes to the app in supported parts of the world. </p><p>But that's not my concern here. If the only issue was an unstable TikTok experience, well, whatever. But, eventually, the app becomes a security liability. Just as TikTok developers won't be able to push new features or bug fixes for the app, they also won't be able to patch any security vulnerabilities they discover down the line. And there <em>will</em> be security vulnerabilities down the line: That's just an inevitability of software. Eventually, flaws will appear that TikTok will patch for the app in countries it supports, but because it'll be cut off from the U.S., you won't see those updates. Instead, you'll use an app with a growing list of security flaws that bad actors <em>will</em> exploit for their own gain. It probably won't happen overnight, but after some time, the app becomes a real risk to keep on your device&mdash;especially when malicious users know that a country as large as the United States has people using an app without security patches.</p><p>Ironically, in banning the app for national security reasons, the U.S. government will have turned it into a security risk of a different making. </p><h2 id="but-will-you-want-to-keep-using-tiktok-anyway">But will you want to keep using TikTok anyway?</h2><p>At the moment, TikTok is back. But what if a sale doesn't happen, and TikTok eventually goes dark for good? Will you actually want to keep using the app? Sure, at first, everything will likely seem the same, but as the app gets buggier and less secure, the experience will undoubtedly lose its luster. </p><p>But it goes beyond that, too. American creators are likely not going to bother posting to an app that is banned in their country, and will switch full-time to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-pros-and-cons-of-best-tiktok-alternatives" target="_blank">other established platforms like Instagram and YouTube</a>. As more and more creators leave, you'll see less of the content you're used to engaging with&mdash;content you could find on apps that aren't banned. </p><p>Must of the rest of the world will still be posting to TikTok, of course, but it will be interesting to see if any ripple effects come out of this potential ban. Will the loss of hundreds of millions of users inspire creators outside the U.S. to focus on platforms Americans can use? If so, will TikTok start to lose even more content? The entire situation is unprecedented, so we really will just have to see.</p><p>In any case, to make sure you can always access your favorite TikTok content, even if the app is no longer accessible or safe to use, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-save-all-your-tiktok-content" target="_blank">download your videos right now</a>.</p><p><em>This article was updated Sunday, Jan. 19 with new info after TikTok went dark. </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Take a good, hard look at exactly where your money is going.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2H1WG69W3AZBTDYYMAQQ73/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know what it's like when the thought of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/scary-hour-financial-planning" target="_blank">looking at your personal finances</a> makes your stomach churn. The first step to getting control of your spending is to take a hard look at where your money actually goes. Now, I've <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-much-do-small-daily-purchases-really-affect-your-l-1849328048" target="_blank">previously lamented</a> how many sources like to overstate the impact of small purchases, like your morning iced coffee, on your long-term finances. At the same time, you really shouldn&rsquo;t be spending more than you earn, which makes it difficult to pay off debts and save money for the future. </p><p>If you don&rsquo;t know where to get started making a budget, or your current one doesn&rsquo;t seem to work for you, a spending audit is a great way to get the right numbers and make a plan that works for you. Because whether you deliberately ignore certain <a href="https://lifehacker.com/stop-your-unconscious-spending-1849826638" target="_blank">bad spending habits</a> or you&rsquo;ve fallen prey to a larger trend of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/beware-the-costs-of-lifestyle-creep-1849672721#:~:text=Lifestyle%20creep%20is%20the%20pattern,DoorDash%20multiple%20nights%20a%20week." target="_blank">lifestyle creep</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to lose track of where<em> some</em> of your cash is going. Here&rsquo;s how to perform a spending audit and position yourself to make better financial decisions in the future.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-spending-audit">What is a spending audit?</h2><p>An audit is a review, not a budget. Many people choose to look forward and create a budget without being honest about their current spending habits. But the goal of &ldquo;cutting back on spending&rdquo; is abstract and hard to achieve. Better to figure out what you&rsquo;re actually spending first, and go from there.<br><br>Think of your spending audit as the sometimes painful, but definitely necessary, first step to creating a budget that actually works for you. Review all of your transactions from a certain amount of time&mdash;for our purposes, let&rsquo;s say three months of spending. Then, consider what the results say about your spending habits and what you can change.</p><h2 id="how-to-conduct-your-spending-audit">How to conduct your spending audit</h2><p>Here's how to conduct an effective spending audit that will help your spending habits going forward.</p><h3>Gather all your numbers</h3><p>Kick off your audit by collecting around three months' worth of financial statements from all your accounts, including:</p><ul><li><p>Credit card statements</p></li><li><p>Bank account transactions</p></li><li><p>Digital payment services (PayPal, Venmo, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Cash expenditures (tracked through receipts)</p></li></ul><p>I find that three months provides enough data to identify patterns while remaining manageable to analyze. Having all this information in one place helps create a complete picture of your spending habits.</p><h3>Categorize your transactions</h3><p>Create meaningful categories that reflect your lifestyle. Common categories include:</p><ul><li><p>Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities, maintenance)</p></li><li><p>Transportation (car payments, fuel, public transit)</p></li><li><p>Food (groceries, dining out)</p></li><li><p>Entertainment (streaming services, hobbies, events)</p></li><li><p>Healthcare (insurance, medications, appointments)</p></li><li><p>Personal care (haircuts, gym memberships, clothing)</p></li><li><p>Debt payments (student loans, credit cards)</p></li></ul><p>Go through each transaction and assign it to a category. Be honest with yourself&mdash;that coffee shop visit might be "food" or "entertainment," depending on your perspective and habits.</p><h3>Start looking for pattens</h3><p>Next, look for patterns that illuminate your spending behavior. One way to do this is to mark each item on your bank statements. Place a star next to necessary purchases, a check next to discretionary purchases that you feel good about, and an &ldquo;X&rdquo; next to ones that are more questionable. </p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve marked all the expenses that you regret or want to change going forward, group them together and ask yourself some questions to identify your problem areas. Think: Is your coffee habit out of control? Are you spending too much on a gym membership you rarely use? Have your monthly subscriptions gotten out of hand? Are your debt payments higher than you can afford right now? You might be surprised to find how many expenses you&rsquo;ll be able to eliminate, whether because they were unintentional or were motivated by stress.</p><h3>Create a budget that suits your lifestyle</h3><p>Finally, at the end of the audit, add up all these problem areas to get a rough approximation of how much money you could route into savings if you changed your habits. Calculate percentages for each category relative to your total spending. Compare these to common financial guidelines, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-a-simple-50-20-30-household-budget-1847941329" target="_blank">such as the 50/30/20 rule</a> (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings).</p><p>A spending audit is a simple exercise that lets you spend a little more consciously now, before things get out of control later. And now that you&rsquo;ve conducted your audit, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/seven-ways-budget-and-how-to-pick-the-best-one-for-you" target="_blank">here are some ways</a> you can get started actually putting together a budget.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is exactly what it sounds like: a Kindle e-reader with color. It's essentially the same hardware and design as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxLWJ?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Kindle%20Paperwhite%20Signature%20Edition&amp;short_url=QbxLWJ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a>, with the same dimensions, weight, and 32GB of storage. It also has the same features, like the automatically adjusting front light, the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/dust-resistant-waterproof-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings" target="_self" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>IPX8 rating</u></a> waterproof rating, wireless charging, and an ad-free lock screen that either shows the cover for the book you're reading, or generic wallpapers. The battery life is shorter than a Paperwhite, with eight weeks compared to 12, but still plenty for most people.</p><p>The seven-inch color E Ink display seems to be the industry standard 300 pixels per inch (ppi) for black-and-white content and 150ppi for color, according to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-signature-edition" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag's review</a>. If you love reading comics, this is where the Colorsoft Signature Edition shines. The colors looks like printed newspaper quality, and there's a feature that provides a close-up of each comic panel so you can enjoy the art and read it without having to zoom in. </p><p>Although the screen doesn't get too bright (94 nits of brightness), the screen does a good job at deflecting glare. The auto light adjuster is nice if you're coming indoors and outdoors a lot. I personally love the warm and cool front-light settings, as I like to read at night and not stress my eyes before bed. </p><p>Considering it's only $29.99 more to upgrade from the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition to the color version, it makes it a great deal for anyone who needs a bit more color in their life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Here's What's New in iOS 18.3</title>

      <description>AI News summaries are taking a hiatus.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JFAPPAAMJBHQMHAQE133WPSG/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-182-is-here-with-new-apple-intelligence-features" target="_blank">When Apple dropped iOS 18.2</a>, it made a bit of a splash&mdash;especially for iPhones compatible with Apple Intelligence. The update brought dedicated image generation to iOS, including both <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-apple-ai-image-generator" target="_blank">Image Playground and Genmoji</a>, as well as an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-ai-in-the-iphone-mail-app" target="_blank">AI-updated Mail experience</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/it-just-got-easier-to-change-your-iphone-default-apps" target="_blank">more control over default apps</a>.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, we've had our first look at the company's next update for iPhones: iOS 18.3. Apple seeded developers the first beta for 18.3 on Monday, Dec. 16. As of this latest update, Jan. 17, we're on beta number three. </p><p>There's not much new, however. If these first three betas&nbsp;are any indication, iOS 18.3 is not going to be a feature-filled update; rather, it will be one that brings some minor changes and bug fixes to iPhones. Big Siri changes, for example, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/siris-apple-intelligence-upgrades-are-still-a-few-updates-away" target="_blank">will probably ship with iOS 18.4</a>.</p><p>That said, Apple could add more features and changes in subsequent beta updates for iOS 18.3. As the company continues beta testing, and eventually releases the full iOS 18.3 update to compatible iPhones, I'll update this piece to report on what's new. In the meantime, here's what we know is coming based on this first developer beta. </p><h2 id="robot-vacuum-support-in-home-app">Robot vacuum support in Home app</h2><p>Apple's Home app does not currently support robot vacuums, but it will soon. The company first announced support as part of iOS 18 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/16/ios-18-3-beta-adding-home-app-support-for-robot-vacuums/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">back in June</a>, but then kicked back the release. Officially, robot vacuum support is delayed, but <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1868737613659881823?s=61" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris found code</a> in iOS 18.3 beta 1 indicating the new update supports these vacuums:  </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1868737613659881823" title="open in a new window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.
    </a>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, Apple says the following about robot vacuum support in iOS 18, which it still says is coming in an update: "The Home app now supports the core functionality of robot vacuum cleaners, such as power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status. They can also participate in automations and scenes, and respond to Siri requests. So you can add them to your cleaning routine&mdash;or tell Siri to do some spot cleaning in the living room." </p><h2 id="ai-news-summaries-are-out-for-now">AI news summaries are out (for now)</h2><p>Apple's AI summaries have had some mixed results, especially when it comes to summarizing news stories. In fact, the company got itself into hot water last month: Apple's AI incorrectly summarized a BBC news story, saying that Luigi Mangione, the UnitedHealthcare shooting suspect, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">had killed himself in prison</a>. That, of course, was not true, and the BBC ended up complaining to Apple over the mistake. </p><p>With 18.3 beta 3, Apple seems to be admitting it has more work to do on its AI bot: With this beta, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apples-latest-ios-beta-quietly-kills-ai-news-notifications" target="_blank">AI summaries for news and entertainment notifications are disabled</a>. This is only a temporary measure, and only applies to those running the latest beta. Apple now also warns users to double-check AI summarized headlines, and displays summaries in italics to highlight them from other notification alerts. Finally, with the beta, you can disable notification summaries for specific apps directly from the Lock Screen.</p><h2 id="repeated-calculations-are-back">Repeated calculations are back</h2><p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/07/ios-18-3-beta-2-fixes-key-calculator-issue-introduced-last-fall/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">As 9to5Mac discovered</a>, the second 18.3 beta brings back something that never should have left&mdash;repeated calculations. For some reason, Apple removed the ability to keep a calculation going when you tap the equals key with iOS 18 (e.g., hitting equals after five times five gives you 25, and hitting equals again then multiplies by five again to get you 125). If you have the beta, this feature is back. </p><h2 id="genmoji-has-a-spot-in-the-messages-sidebar">Genmoji has a spot in the Messages sidebar</h2><p>With 18.3 beta 3, Apple has added Genmoji to the Messages sidebar&mdash;the menu you see when pressing (+). <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/make-your-own-weird-emojis-on-iphone-with-genmoji" target="_blank">This adds another method to accessing Genmoji</a>, in addition to using the emoji keyboard.  </p><h2 id="pdf-changes">PDF changes</h2><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/everything-new-in-ios-18-3-beta-3/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">As reported by MacRumors</a>, when you try to crop a PDF in 18.3 beta 3, you now see a warning that the data being cropped out isn't really gone. The message itself reads: "Content outside the cropped area won't be visible in most PDF viewers, but it can be made visible in some apps."</p><h2 id="apple-may-be-working-on-an-invites-app">Apple may be working on an "Invites" app </h2><p>9to5Mac also found code in the latest beta that points to an "Invites" app Apple may be cooking up for future release. In fact, the site found this code in an iOS 18.2 beta, but Apple removed it. It now appears to be back.</p><p>9to5Mac believes this Invites app would act as a meeting scheduler and organizer. It has functionality with Apple's GroupKit, which can keep track of a group of potential attendees, including whether or not individuals have agreed to attend a meet. At this point, it's not clear whether this will be a standalone app, or integrated in existing apps across iOS.     </p><h2 id="give-ai-image-generation-feedback">Give AI image generation feedback</h2><p>Part of how AI image generation improves is through user feedback: If a model spits out an image, and the user says something went wrong, the model can then take that feedback in as part of its training, and, hopefully, return a result that is closer to the expectation over time. </p><p>With iOS 18.3, Apple has added a thumbs-up and thumbs-down option for image generation for both Image Playground and Genmoji. When using the beta, you'll have the option to quickly tell iOS whether the image or emoji it generated is right or if it missed the mark.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h2><p>iOS 18.3 developer beta 1 added two fixes for bugs in previous versions of iOS. One is for Genmoji, and fixes an issue where a personalized Genmoji wouldn't generate without selecting another person first. The other fixes a bug with Writing Tools, where third-party apps using the Writing Tools API wouldn't be able to use the inline experience if the first responder is not a UIView. (This one, as you might guess, is specifically for developers.)</p><h2 id="genmoji-is-coming-to-macos-153">Genmoji is coming to macOS 15.3</h2><p>This one won't apply to your iPhone, but if you have a Mac, be aware that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/macos-sequoia-15-3-genmoji-for-mac/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Apple is bringing Genmoji support with macOS 15.3</a>. Genmoji is probably my favorite of the Apple Intelligence features: I would, quite literally, never use images generated from Image Playground for anything, but I do enjoy generating a custom emoji to react to a part of my current conversation. Apple isn't bringing Image Playground to the Mac yet, but that's fine: Genmoji support will be more than enough.   </p><h2 id="how-to-install-ios-183">How to install iOS 18.3</h2><p>Again, iOS 18.3 is currently in beta, and should not be installed haphazardly. At this time, the beta really is meant only for developers to test their apps out on the new OS, and alert Apple to any bugs they find. As such, it's not meant for general use, so unintended consequences could arise from downloading it on a personal device. </p><p>If you're okay assuming those risks (please, back up any important data first), it's quite easy to install 18.3 right now. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-download-ios-18-on-iphone" target="_blank">You'll just need an iPhone compatible with iOS 18</a>. To install the developer beta, sign into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">developer.apple.com</a> on this iPhone with your Apple ID. To install the public beta, make sure you've enrolled your iPhone from <a href="https://beta.apple.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">beta.apple.com</a>. Then, head to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>General &gt; Software Update</strong>. From here, tap <strong>Beta Updates</strong>, then choose either <strong>iOS 18 Developer Beta </strong>or<strong> iOS 18 Public Beta</strong>. Tap <strong>Back</strong>, then, after a moment, you should see <strong>iOS 18.3 Beta 3</strong>. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the software on your iPhone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>20 Movies to Remind You the Government Can’t Be Trusted</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Governments lie. They cheat. They steal. Sometimes the blame comes from within: corrupt individuals who&rsquo;d conned their ways into the halls of power with no moral compass beyond their own self-aggrandizement. Sometimes, the fault lies within ourselves: We&rsquo;re drawn to populist politicians who tell us what we want to hear even when we ought to know better.</p><p>The 1970s, in particular, loom large in movies about government corruption, even in later films. It&rsquo;s not that no one had ever mistrusted the government before, but it&rsquo;s the era when anti-government feeling truly entered the zeitgeist. Then, as now, people couldn&rsquo;t agree on much, but they could agree that political leaders weren&rsquo;t to be trusted. From there, the &lsquo;80s saw Iran-Contra, the &lsquo;90s saw the Clinton impeachment, the &lsquo;00s the Iraq War&mdash;and those are just the marquee scandals.</p><p>The less said about the modern era of politics, perhaps, the better. But we may find it helpful to go back a bit in time, and/or overseas, to find movies that hold up a harsh mirror to government corruption.</p><h2 id="seven-days-in-may-1964"><em>Seven Days in May</em> (1964)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>John Frankenheimer&rsquo;s follow-up to <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em> sees President Fredric March working on a nuclear disarmament deal with the Soviet Union, a development that doesn&rsquo;t impress a popular general played by Burt Lancaster. He&rsquo;s planning a coup, one that's uncovered by Kirk Douglas over the course of the title&rsquo;s seven days. It&rsquo;s another trenchant look at the ways in which both personal charisma and military power can have undue sway over American politics. <strong>You can rent <em>Seven Days in May</em> from Prime Video.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p><em>The Conversation</em> isn&rsquo;t about Watergate or Vietnam, but it speaks as well as any movie to the well-earned political paranoia of the era. Gene Hackman (never better than he is here) plays surveillance expert Harry Caul, already desperately paranoid when he overhears a conversation he shouldn&rsquo;t about a potential murder. Though ostensibly about private peccadillos, the film was released in the same year as Richard Nixon&rsquo;s resignation (aided by his own White House tapes), and is prescient about the growing surveillance state, but also deeply conflicted. Harry means well, and there are clearly benefits to the work he does, but there are also the very obvious privacy concerns, as well as the potential to misinterpret situations and entire lives based on out-of-context bits of information. There&rsquo;s nothing broached here that we&rsquo;re not still grappling with, over 50 years later. <strong>You can stream <em>The Conversation</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Ypmd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Paramount%2B&amp;short_url=a5Ypmd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Paramount+</a></strong><strong> and The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6oKZq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z6oKZq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>If you only know Andy Griffith from Mayberry, prepare yourself for his greatest performance, one that's as chilling as it is prescient. Here, he plays Larry "Lonesome" Rhodes, an alcoholic drifter whose folksy good humor and facility for the guitar land him a radio deal with the help of journalist Marcia Jeffries (Patricia Neal), who becomes his promoter and girlfriend. It all ultimately steers him into the world of politics, with Jeffries discovering much too late that she&rsquo;s created a monster. If you can imagine a politician telling his supporters everything they want to hear while sneering at them behind their backs, you might even say that the rise of populist Larry Rhodes foretells the Donald Trump era. <strong>You can stream <em>A Face in the Crowd</em> on The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXN1r?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9yXN1r&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Sitting squarely in the middle of the Vietnam War and sandwiched between the assassinations of the 1960s and Watergate, director Alan J. Pakula created a masterpiece of political paranoia that conveys a sense of mounting dread with each and every noir-inspired frame. Warren Beatty plays Joseph Frady, a journalist who gets caught up in an incredibly complex conspiracy after he witnesses the murder of a sitting senator and presidential candidate. There&rsquo;s much more than simple assassination going on, but there&rsquo;s also more to Frady&rsquo;s quest for truth than simple heroism; unsettlingly, the movie&rsquo;s thriller plot line conceals a believably complex world in which there are no easy answers. In a broken and corrupt system, even the best of intentions can make things much worse. <strong>You can rent The Parallax View from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4KWE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aN4KWE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>What became Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s Dr. Strangelove began life as a drama: Based on the thriller novel <em>Red Alert</em>, Kubrick intended, initially, to play it straight. It wasn&rsquo;t very far into the screenplay-writing process, however, when the director realized that real-world concepts like the nuclear &ldquo;balance of terror&rdquo; and &ldquo;mutually assured destruction&rdquo; were better suited to farce than serious drama. The result is one of cinema&rsquo;s most perfect send-ups of government overreach, personality politics, and the behind-the-scenes dust-ups that have frequently had devastating consequences for humans without the privilege of their own quiet war rooms. <strong>You can rent Dr. <em>Strangelove</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxNEe?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QbxNEe&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The Nixon administration served as the wellspring of 1970s cinematic paranoia, and it's fortunate that one of the best of the decade's thrillers is based on the true story of everything that went down when a couple of plucky Washington Post reporters (played here by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman) started sniffing around a seemingly innocuous burglary in Washington's Watergate complex. The resulting investigation, involving secret recordings, slush funds, and a secret informant known for decades only as "Deep Throat" revealed a criminal cover-up tied to the President himself. A fun throwback to a time when we were bothered by such things. <strong><em>You can rent All the President's Men</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/924yre?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=924yre&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Clearly inspired by the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, the Russo Brothers (and company) crafted a Marvel movie in the same spirit. The Disney-owned heroes typically fight to uphold, rather than upend, the status quo, so<em> Winter Soldier</em> is all the more impressive for seeing Cap as an outlaw. Working as part of espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve uncovers a massive government conspiracy (Hail Hydra!) tied to Cabinet member Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) that puts him on the wrong side of the law. Before it's over, he's hunted for having learned about a secretive surveillance operation with ties back to Marvel's version of Operation Paperclip, the real-life program that secretly brought German scientists (including Nazis) to the United States.

<p>What sounds like a sci-fi action movie about the first crewed mission to Mars quickly reveals itself to be something else entirely: a conspiracy theory born of Watergate but tying in, however inadvertently, to Moon-landing denial conspiracies. Starring Sam Waterston, James Brolin, Elliott Gould, Brenda Vaccaro, and O.J. Simpson, the movie finds the Mars crew pulled from the mission at the last minute&mdash;it seems that the government wants the boost that would be provided by a successful mission, but isn't at all confident that they'd actually make it. The empty craft is launched, the crew are essentially held hostage, and, when the capsule blows up on reentry to Earth, it quickly becomes clear that anyone who knows the truth has to be eliminated. <strong>You can stream <em>Capricorn One</em> on Tubi, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RZPR?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z3RZPR&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGYb8?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Peacock&amp;short_url=QGGYb8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Peacock</a></strong><strong>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RZPR?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Freevee&amp;short_url=z3RZPR&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Freevee</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Just before the Bill Clinton impeachment (and a suspiciously timed bombing in Iraq), and a few years before themes and obfuscations of the Iraq War, Barry Levinson made this all-star, <em>Strangelove</em>-esque satire about a Hollywood producer tasked with creating a fake war with Albania in order to conceal a Presidential sex scandal. Though a dark comedy, the film&rsquo;s plot wouldn&rsquo;t be the dumbest reason we&rsquo;ve gone to war&mdash;not by a long shot. <strong>You can rent <em>Wag the Dog</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/924XkE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=924XkE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Korean filmmakers, in film and television, have had no trouble whatsoever with exploring both the excesses of capitalism nor government corruption&mdash;perhaps that&rsquo;s part of the appeal to American audiences saddled with an increasingly status-quo friendly Disney/Marvel hegemony. Here, writer/director Woo Min-ho manages to mine action from the story of a rising Presidential candidate who only gets as far as he does because a conservative newspaper and its biggest sponsor want him in the top job (big media colluding with candidates to swing an election&mdash;who'd have thought?). The corrupt connections between corporate media and political candidates are problems that are hardly limited to the Korean peninsula. <strong>You can stream <em>Inside Men</em> on Tubi or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41PB4?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=Q41PB4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>It&rsquo;s been suggested that Brill Lyle, Gene Hackman&rsquo;s character in Tony Scott&rsquo;s <em>Enemy of the State</em>, is so close in temperament to <em>The Conversation</em>&rsquo;s Harry Caul that they might very well be the same character. Which is interesting, especially given that it caps Hackman&rsquo;s long run of political thrillers&mdash;but they&rsquo;re also very different movies. This one is everything <em>The Conversation</em> isn&rsquo;t: big, loud, flashy, and more interested in action set-pieces than in saying anything coherent about surveillance. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not a lot of fun, with large helpings of that <em>X-Files</em>-ish style of heightened political paranoia that was soon to give way to actual events. Will Smith plays well-meaning lawyer Robert Clayton Dean, who&rsquo;s caught up in a wild conspiracy following the government-sponsored assassination of a political candidate. <strong>You can rent <em>Enemy of the State</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrX0PE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QrX0PE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

</div>


<p>A stylish and fast-moving genre mashup, <em>They Cloned Tyrone</em> spins plenty of plates&mdash;and mostly manages to keep them from crashing down. John Bodega stars as Fontaine, a drug dealer in a world just this side of our own (there&rsquo;s definitely some Blaxsploitation influence in the dress styles). Following a showdown with one-time Pimp of the Year, Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx), Fontaine is shot dead before waking up in his own bed with nothing, seemingly, having changed. Teaming up with Slick Charles and sex worker Yo Yo (Teyonah Parris), he leads the three of them into an unlikely web of a government conspiracy lead by Keifer Sutherland's appropriately named "Nixon," one that involves using poor Black men (think the real-life Tuskegee Experiment) as test subjects. <strong>You can stream <em>They Cloned Tyrone</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80996324" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A relatively early masterpiece from director John Frankenheimer, the film was a victim of its own tragically prescient timing: Released just a year before the assassination of President Kennedy, that real-life event overtook the movie and interest in revisiting it waned until a critical reevaluation decades later. On one level, the movie is a Cold War thriller about a Medal of Honor recipient brainwashed to serve as a communist agent. If that&rsquo;s all it were, it wouldn&rsquo;t be much more than a period piece; Frankenheimer and company, instead, take aim at the ways in which Americans are easily manipulated and distracted&mdash;Lawrence Harvey&rsquo;s Raymond Shaw is able to go as far as he does because people are blinded by his military achievements. Meanwhile, Joseph McCarthy-esque demagogues use accusations to deflect from real dangers. It also boasts an absolutely chilling performance from Angela Lansbury as Shaw&rsquo;s scheming and vaguely incestuous mother. <strong>You can rent <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5YVX?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QL5YVX&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The conspiracy surrounding the real-life Tuskegee Experiment continues to this day, inasmuch as discussions of the 40-year government medical study that used poor Black men as unwitting test subjects remain minimal. By the end, hundreds had been deceived about their medical treatments and conditions, and over 100 had died as a result of deliberately ineffective medical treatment, all in the name of medical research on syphilis. The film tells the story from the perspective of Nurse Eunice Evers (Alfre Woodard), based on the real-life nurse who became a trailblazer as one of the very first African-Americans to be employed by the U.S. Public Health Service, only to find herself in the role of collaborator. <strong>You can stream <em>Miss Evers' Boys</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOYlD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=QKOYlD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>John Carpenter's gloriously unsubtle satire of commercialism capitalism, American-style, finds a drifter (Roddy Piper) discovering, via a pair of sunglasses, that the world as we know it is a facade run by a ruling class that's concealed subliminal messages everywhere: messages like <em>consume, breed, conform</em>. You know, the stuff that we're really good at. Knowing the truth about the ultimate conspiracy, our musclebound protagonist isn't going to give in without a fight. <strong>You can rent <em>They Live</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXJqx?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QxXJqx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s the ending here that makes <em>Z</em> so darkly memorable&mdash;which is not to say that the movie isn&rsquo;t a classic through and through. Costa-Gavras&rsquo; satire of government corruption was released smack in the middle of a period of military junta control in Greece, but also in a global period of political assassinations and wars of false pretenses. A magistrate investigates the political murder of a left-wing politician, only to come up against an increasingly absurd, but nevertheless believable, series of walls and obfuscations. <strong>You can stream <em>Z</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4be1?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=zj4be1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> and The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RZjE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z3RZjE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

    <div id="video-container-orhrsjDwamY"></div>
</div>


<p><em>The X-Files</em>&rsquo; overarching mythology was always far too broad to ever really amount to anything coherent; it&rsquo;s also hard to get too worked up over secret alien colonists (or something) when the real world poses so many more immediate threats. Still, there&rsquo;s no question that the show and its spin-offs exemplify a &lsquo;90s style of anti-government paranoia&mdash;one that imagines political officials as being competent, focused, and forward-thinking enough to manage any number of conspiracies over the course of decades. Where <em>X-Files</em>, and this movie in particular, was surprisingly prescient was in its imagined world of conspiracies, one in which everyone wants to believe everything all the time. As a standalone, the first movie summarizes the <em>X-Files</em> experience fairly adeptly, with government agents concealing the existence of an ancient alien virus with the help of some nasty bees. Its most memorably goofy moment, in which Martin Landau reveals the truth about "FEMA&mdash;the secret government!" has evolved into an actual conspiracy theory over the decades because of course it has. <strong>You can rent The <em>X-Files</em> movie (sometimes subtitled <em>Fight the Future</em>) from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmX0l3?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QmX0l3&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>We know &ldquo;cabin in the wood&rdquo;-style horror movies, and we know how they're meant to work. So, while <em>Cabin in the Woods</em> initially looks like a <em>Scream</em>-style deconstruction of the genre, it quickly reveals itself to be something far more ambitious, veering from near-parody to apocalyptic stakes. A couple of slightly goofy government agents are watching everything that goes on with our horny and hunted campers, all of whom find themselves part of a bloody global conspiracy&mdash;at least the ones who survive. <strong>You can stream <em>Cabin in the Woods</em> on <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/465287/the-cabin-in-the-woods" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Tubi</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/akRVWY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=akRVWY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

</div>


<p>A very silly but nonetheless surprisingly smart comedy about two big-hearted teen friends who are, perhaps, not the brightest (think a &lsquo;70s-era Romy &amp; Michele), <em>Dick</em> stars Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams as deeply naive D.C. residents who become entangled in the events surrounding the Watergate break-in. At first enamored with President Nixon (a perfectly cast Dan Hedaya), the two gradually come to realize that he&rsquo;s not the well-meaning charmer that they&rsquo;ve taken him for; their resulting revenge is deeply satisfying. It&rsquo;s often hilarious, but also serves as a pretty solid metaphor for the comedown that we face as a nation, and as individuals, when our political hopes are dashed. It's a reminder to not get too attached and, for my money, as good a movie about Watergate as you're likely to find. <strong>You can rent <em>Dick</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmX08n?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QmX08n&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A superior paranoid thriller, as long as you're willing to buy Robert Redford as a nerd. Here he plays a bookish CIA analyst codenamed Condor who shows up to work one day to find that everyone in his office has been murdered. It seems their analysis of a thriller novel with real-world implications was getting a little to close to something. The ensuing cat-and-mouse game leads Condor into the heart of a government plot involving global oil supplies&mdash;the assumption being that Americans would tolerate literally anything in the name of cheap gas. And where's the lie? <strong>You can stream <em>Three Days of the Condor</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/98LyAd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Paramount%2B&amp;short_url=98LyAd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Paramount+</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YO4Rn?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9YO4Rn&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google hasn't been shy about pushing the Gemini AI bot into just about every app and device it can&mdash;from the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-use-gemini-to-build-google-home-automations-but-should-you" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> to your <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/gemini-take-notes-during-google-meet-calls" target="_blank">video calls</a>&mdash;and most of the time you get the same experience when you call up the assistant. If you need a more bespoke AI bot, however, you can tailor Gemini by creating your own Gems.</p><p>Gems are essentially different flavors of Gemini with their own specific instructions and rules. For example, you could create a Gem that explains difficult concepts in a simple way, or a Gem that's specifically geared toward improving your coding skills.</p><p>These Gems don't bring anything new that you can't already get through the main Gemini AI,  but they can be useful because they are more specific and focused. You can also upload files to give your Gems customized "knowledge" beyond Gemini's main training.</p><p>For the time being ,at least, you can only use Gemini Gems if you're a paid <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-gemini-advanced-review" target="_blank">Gemini Advanced subscriber</a>, giving Google $20 a month.(I haven't heard anything yet about if or when the feature might make its way to free users.) </p><h2 id="creating-new-gems">Creating new Gems</h2><p>You can access your Gemini Gems from any device where you're logged into Google, but to create new Gems. you need to be using <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the Gemini web app</a>. To get started, click the <strong>Gem manager</strong> link on the left (click the three lines, top left, if the side panel is hidden): You're then shown a number of premade Gems you can already tap into.</p><p>These cover topics such as coding, writing, and careers advice, and they give you an idea of what's possible with Gemini Gems. Click on any of these Gems to test them out (you'll also see a gallery of suggested prompts), or click the copy button (two rectangles) to duplicate a Gem so you can edit it yourself.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Opt to copy a premade Gem, and the information used to build it is shown on screen: You can click anywhere to make changes to the instructions that are already there, and give the Gem a new name. You can even get Gemini's help in writing instructions, via the button that looks like a pen with a star next to it.</p><p>Creating your own Gem is a lot like editing an existing one. From the Gem manager screen, click <strong>New Gem</strong>. You'll then give your Gem a name, and some instructions. These instructions can cover the subjects the Gem should concentrate on, the type of language and tone it should use, and anything it should definitely not do (like go off on a tangent).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the Knowledge field, you can upload your own documents: So if your Gem is an expert on DNA, for example, you might want to upload some scientific papers on the topic. This also lets you create custom Gems based around any kind of interest or subject, as long as you've got references for the AI to look at.</p><p>Any documents you add will work on top of Gemini's existing training, and you can test out your Gem using the input box on the right, making further tweaks along the way if necessary. When you're happy with how the Gem is performing and responding to your prompts, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p><h2 id="chatting-with-your-gems">Chatting with your Gems</h2><p>Any Gems you've created can be called up as needed from the <strong>Gem manager</strong> on the left-hand side of the web interface, and you'll also find them available in the Gemini mobile apps&mdash;just make sure you've got the right one selected before you start chatting.</p><p>Everything works just as it does with the main Gemini AI: You enter your prompts by typing or speaking (via the microphone button), and you get the responses back on screen. As usual, you can rank the quality of the responses with the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons, get Gemini to try again (the circular arrow button), and see the sources the chatbot has used underneath the response.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If Gemini has made use of documents you've uploaded to it, you'll see this reflected at the top of the response: Click <strong>Analysis complete</strong> to see a breakdown. You can also specify that your Gem refers to specific documents for specific answers in your prompts, if needed.</p><p>This ability to upload documents is what can really make Gems useful. For example, you could upload an essay on your favorite music and movies and develop a Gem to make recommendations&mdash;all of this information will be retained, and you don't have to enter it each time you use Gemini. You could also upload examples of your own writing, so your Gem writes more like you do.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>These bespoke AI bots are also helpful when you want answers returned in a consistent way, or in a consistent format: Maybe you just want a playlist generator and nothing else, for example, or you need text rewriting in a particular style. Gems can do this without having the same repeated prompt commands used each time.</p><p>You can use the <strong>+</strong> (plus) button at the bottom of Gem chats to upload files and images to use with your prompts, just as you can with any Gemini chat. However, you don't have access to the more natural <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-gemini-live-on-your-android-phone" target="_blank">Gemini Live</a> voice interface inside Gems&mdash;you only get the basic voice interaction mode as well as the typing option.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Embrace the weird side of Genmoji.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHTBVHXPPHYJFBTCK8Q6N670/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of all the new and weird AI features in Apple Intelligence, perhaps Genmoji is the most exciting one. Though it's in beta, and its <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-apple-ai-image-generator" target="_blank">output can range from weird to terrifying</a>, it's still fun to make and sure your own custom emojis.</p><p>Genmoji, as the name sounds, is an amalgamation of generative AI and Emoji. Simply put, you give it a prompt, and it will generate an emoji&mdash;a small, sticker-sized image that can be saved to be reused in chats. While you're always limited by Apple's guardrails, you can use the feature to create emojis that you wish existed, but don't. Of course, generative AI is far from perfect, and you may find you generate Genmoji that you wish were never created.</p><p>Like with Image Playground, getting something good out of Genmoji can be a struggle. But I'll walk you through how the feature works, and how you can create something that both works and is fun. If you'd like to annoy your spouse with a rainbow glitter poop emoji in a middle of the workday, here's how to make it happen.</p><h2 id="how-to-create-genmoji-on-your-iphone">How to create Genmoji on your iPhone</h2><p>To access Genmoji, you'll need to use <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-finally-has-image-generation" target="_blank">iOS 18.2</a> on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 series. Then, you'll need to sign up and clear the Image Playground waitlist. To do this, open the Image Playground app, and tap <strong>Request Early Access</strong>. When it's ready, you'll receive a notification and Genmoji will be unlocked.</p><p>Once you've done that, you can create a Genmoji anywhere on the iPhone, right from the keyboard. Tap the <strong>Emoji</strong> button to switch to the Emoji keyboard, then tap the new colorful rainbow <strong>Emoji</strong> button in the top-right. (In general, the way to spot an Apple Intelligence feature is to look for the new, colorful thing that has come out of nowhere.)</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Now, you'll see a new Genmoji creation screen. Here, give it a prompt, as detailed as you can. You can make things really weird by using your name, or anyone in your contact book, and make an emoji based on an AI-generated version of their face. Results might be jarring, or hilarious. Here's me in a cowboy hat for reference.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Genmoji will generate multiple emojis, and you can swipe through all the versions it makes. When you find one you like, tap the <strong>Add</strong> button from the top. This will send the Genmoji to the current conversation, and it will be added to your Stickers area in the Emoji keyboard&mdash;ready to be used again and again.</p><p>If you like a Genmoji that someone has sent, you can tap on it to view details and add it to your own collection.</p><h2 id="tips-on-creating-fun-genmoji">Tips on creating fun Genmoji</h2><p>Generating a good Genmoji means waking a thin line between absurdist AI images, and something that looks like a regular emoji, all while staying within Apple's guardrails.

<p>That said, I was able to generate an angry emoji flipping the bird, so that's nice. And yes, for scientific reasons, I can confirm that you indeed can generate an emoji featuring an eggplant on a peach. But guns are off limits: Like regular emojis, you're stuck with water pistols, if anything at all.  </p><p>The key to a good Genmoji is being descriptive. Use specific words describing feelings or emotions (e.g. "happy," or "tears"), and use descriptive verbs, then mix and match these things to see what Genmoji ends up creating. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries or different wording to get what you want. When I started out, I couldn't get it to generate a poop emoji, but with some different wording, I was able to get what I wanted, a "poop rainbow glitter" emoji!</p><h2 id="how-to-delete-genmoji">How to delete Genmoji</h2><p>Genmoji, once created, always shows up in suggestions when you open the emoji keyboard. This might get embarrassing if you've made one of the Genmoji I talked about above. And if you try to delete them from the emoji keyboard, you'll find that it's just not possible.

<p>They have a slightly larger design, which helps them stay secure during workouts or commutes. That said, even with their size, they feel surprisingly light. Plus, they come with three silicone eartip sizes to help you find the right fit. The earbuds feature 6mm drivers with a frequency range of 20Hz to 20kHz. They support Bluetooth 5.2 and the AptX and SBC codecs. However, iOS users might notice the lack of AAC support, which could affect sound quality for high-res listening.</p><p>Each earbud has simple button controls, letting you switch between ANC and HearThrough modes, adjust volume, skip tracks, and access your voice assistant. You can also customize these controls, tweak ANC settings, and fine-tune the sound using the five-band EQ in the companion app. Android users also get extras like Spotify Tap and Google Fast Pair. Battery life is about seven hours per charge, with an extra 21 hours from the case.</p><p>The noise cancellation on these earbuds works well for the price, cutting down low-frequency sounds like airplane hums and muffling noisy environments. The sound profile emphasizes bass, which is great for bass lovers. Plus, there&rsquo;s no distortion at high volumes, and the EQ gives you even more control over the sound, notes this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/jabra-elite-4-active" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag review</a>. Additionally, they have an IP57 rating that makes the earbuds dust-resistant and waterproof&mdash;meaning they can handle sweat, rain, and even a quick rinse. The charging case, however, isn&rsquo;t waterproof, so you'll need to dry the earbuds fully before docking them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hulu's February slate includes the new historical drama series <em>A Thousand Blows</em> (Feb. 21) from the creator of <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. The story is set in 1880s Victorian London amid the world of illegal boxing. Malachi Kirby and Alec Monroe play best friends from Jamaica who get involved with the all-female crime syndicate the Forty Elephants (led by Erin Doherty's character Mary Carr). </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

</div>


<p>Also on the lineup of originals is <em>Muslim Matchmaker</em> (Feb. 11), an unscripted series&mdash;from the creator of <em>Indian Matchmaking</em>&mdash;that helps Muslim-Americans navigate dating. </p><p>Hulu has three true-crime docu-series premiering in February. <em>Wicked Game: Devil in the Desert</em> (Feb. 4), a three-part look into an investigation that began with a kidnapping in the Mojave Desert and led to a global manhunt for the criminal Hossein Nayeri. <em>The Fox Hollow Murders: Playground of a Serial Killer</em> (Feb. 18) is a four-part series about the recent investigation into the crimes of Herb Baumeister, who is believed to have targeted dozens of victims that are now being identified using new DNA technology. Finally, <em>Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke</em> (Feb. 27) covers the story of abuse inside the home of YouTube vlogger Ruby Franke. </p><p>Hulu will also stream the original documentary <em>SLY LIVES! Aka The Burden of Black Genius</em> (Feb. 13) about funk band Sly &amp; The Family Stone, and the sci-fi drama <em>Omni Loop</em> (Feb. 11), which stars Emmy winners Ayo Edebiri and Mary-Louise Parker as a research assistant and quantum physicist attempting to solve time travel. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s everything else coming to (and leaving) Hulu in February, including season six of <em>The Kardashians</em> (Feb. 6).</p><h2 id="whats-coming-to-hulu-in-february-2025">What&rsquo;s coming to Hulu in February 2025</h2><h3>Arriving February 1</h3><ul><li><p><em>BLEACH: Thousand-Year Blood War:</em> Complete Season 3 (Dubbed)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Boruto</em>: Episodes 211-293 (Dubbed)</p></li><li><p><em>Daniel LaBelle: Full Body Funny</em>: Complete Season 1</p></li><li><p><em>MeganPlays: Play It Peachy</em>: Complete Season 1&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Naruto Shippuden: Episodes 474-485 </em>(Dubbed)</p></li><li><p><em>Are We There Yet?</em> (2005)</p></li><li><p><em>Are We There Yet?

What more could a girl ask for? Compared to a microwave or stand mixer, it&rsquo;s an appliance I haven&rsquo;t lived with for very long, but I can&rsquo;t imagine living without it now. Whether it&rsquo;s your first time using an air fryer or your 500th, you&rsquo;ll love these fool-proof dishes. Here are some of my favorite air fryer recipes to date.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="easy-mushroom-chips">Easy mushroom chips</h2><p>Air fryers bring speed, ease, and efficiency to our kitchens and there is no recipe that honors this cooking appliance more than <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/air-fryer-mushroom-chips-recipe" target="_blank">these mushroom chips</a>. It's a two-ingredient recipe that requires hardly any preparation and you are rewarded with a savory, crunchy snack. These mushroom chips can be eaten on their own or as a crunchy topping for soups, salads, or casseroles. They're also naturally gluten-free and vegan. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="meatball-shots">Meatball shots</h2><p>Prepackaged supermarket meatballs make quick and easy work of these cheese-filled meat bites. I enjoy them particularly as a Super Bowl snack, but let's be honest: Sometimes there are no sports on but a savory craving hits nonetheless. These are the three-ingredient snack for you. Simply hollow out the center of a meatball and fill it before crisping up the edges in your air fryer. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/these-meatball-shots-are-my-favorite-football-snack" target="_blank">Read here</a> for the full recipe.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="stuffed-mushrooms">Stuffed mushrooms</h2><p>Stuffed mushrooms are easily in my top three favorite snacks. They're satisfying, bursting with umami and extremely quick to make in the air fryer. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-air-fryer-stuffed-mushroom-recipe" target="_blank">My recipe</a> uses sausage, spices, and a bit of cream cheese to bind it all together but you can easily replace the meat with a different filling of your choice. Once they're in the air fryer, they only take about 10 minutes to cook&mdash;a fraction of the time they would take in the conventional oven.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="scotch-eggs">Scotch eggs</h2><p>Scotch eggs are like breakfast baseballs. A hard-boiled egg is encased in a thick shell of sausage, breaded, and deep fried. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/air-fryer-scotch-egg-recipe" target="_blank"><u>This air fryer recipe</u></a> breaks with tradition, but only just. Instead of using a deep fryer to cook the protein ball, a light spritz of oil and the whipping winds of the air fryer take care of the cooking. The outside crisps up while the sausage remains juicy and the egg doesn&rsquo;t overcook.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="juicy-air-fryer-steak-bites">Juicy air fryer steak bites</h2><p>One of my favorite snacks when I&rsquo;m eating a high-protein diet (and when I can afford it) is a bowl of steak bites. The air fryer makes quick work of these &ldquo;popcorn&rdquo; steak nibbles but beware, the average recipe will have you overcooking them in minutes. Follow <a href="https://lifehacker.com/this-is-the-secret-to-the-best-air-fryer-steak-bites-1850747577" target="_blank"><u>my recipe</u></a> instead and use the freezer to keep your expensive snack juicy and flavorful.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="a-simple-banana-dessert">A simple banana dessert</h2><p>Part of what draws me to cooking in the air fryer is that it invites simplicity. You can&rsquo;t stick a spatula in there while it&rsquo;s cooking and stir things around, there&rsquo;s no adding a splash of this or that halfway through, or covering it with a lid to simmer. It&rsquo;s an appliance where the heat talks, and whatever you put inside either flourishes in the hot winds, or fails. A banana absolutely thrives.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>If you're looking for a new show to watch this week, I got your back. I've scoured the schedules of Netflix, Prime, Max, Hulu, and other streaming platforms to bring you the best and most notable shows streaming this week. </p><p>The biggest show premiering this week is the much-anticipated second season of Apple TV+'s <em>Severance</em>. But there's also <em>Goosebumps: The Vanishing</em>, a <em>Goosebumps</em>-branded horror-for-kids series starring David Schwimmer; and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ2Xen?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=An%20Update%20on%20our%20Family&amp;short_url=zJ2Xen&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>An Update on our Family</em></a>, a documentary series about trashy "family influencers."</p><h2 id="severance-season-2"><em>Severance</em>, season 2</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

</div>


<p>I'm a little nervous for the new season of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXN3w?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Severance&amp;short_url=9yXN3w&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Severance</em></a>. The first season's mix of pitch-black social commentary, ice-cold production design, and acting talent was so good, I'm afraid season two is going to disappoint, especially since I've been waiting for three years. So far, it looks promising: Rotten Tomatoes' critics are nearly <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/severance/s02/reviews" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">universal in their praise</a>, and the trailer looks phenomenal. Season 2 takes us deeper into the mysteries surrounding Lumon Industries, and deeper into the psyches of the people who work there, and the people who don't work there, who are the same people. </p><p>Where to stream: Apple TV+</p><h2 id="goosebumps-the-vanishing"><em>Goosebumps: The Vanishing</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>This horror series stars <em>Friends</em>' David Schwimmer as Anthony, a divorced dad hosting his twin teenage children Devin and Cece for the summer at his Brooklyn home. Anthony only has one rule: Stay out of the basement&mdash;like <em>that's</em> going to happen. The mystery under their feet leads the twins and their friends to dark secrets connected to the disappearance of four teenagers in the 1990s and a supernatural entity of immense power. </p><p>Where to stream: Max</p><h2 id="harley-quinn-season-5"><em>Harley Quinn</em>, season 5 </h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

The pair soon find that something serious is going down in Superman-town, and Quinn will meet up with Lex Luthor, his sister, Lena Luthor, Brainiac, and other comic book favorites in this irreverent take on the DC Universe. <em>Harley Quinn</em> has a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/harley_quinn" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes</a>, so it's definitely worth your time. </p><p>Where to stream: Max</p><h2 id="an-update-on-our-family"><em>An Update On Our Family</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Q-sbt3TN6L4"></div>
</div>


<p>All "family YouTubers" seem pretty weird, but the Stauffer family was next-level reprehensible. This three-part documentary series examines how Myka and James Stauffer built a small vlogging empire by presenting themselves and their children as a perfect family, but took it a step too far when they adopted a baby from China with severe neurological problems. They tried to turn two year-old Huxley into the centerpiece of their content, but he soon disappeared from the family channel and the family.</p><p>Where to stream: Max</p><h2 id="last-weeks-picks">Last week's picks</h2><h2 id="sons-of-ecstasy"><em>Sons of Ecstasy</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

</div>


<p>This documentary examines the rivalry between English stockbroker Shaun Attwood and Gerard Gravano, son of notorious New York mobster Salvatore &ldquo;Sammy the Bull'' Gravano. The conflict played out in the 1990s against the backdrop of the ecstasy boom in Arizona, with both men fighting for control of a desert drug empire built on the rave scene's insatiable appetite for Molly. That's what I call a good subject for a documentary series!</p><p>Where to stream: Max</p><h2 id="the-pitt"><em>The Pitt</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>HBO Originals medical series <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBpmk8?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=The%20Pitt&amp;short_url=aBpmk8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>The Pitt</em></a> was created by <em>ER</em> producer R. Scott Gemmill. The tense, realistic drama takes viewers into the charged emergency room of the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital. Each of <em>The Pitt</em>'s 15 episodes is presented in real time: One episode is one hour of the same shift at the E.R. Noah Wyle stars as Dr. Michael &ldquo;Robby&rdquo; Robinavitch, chief attending physician, who's having trouble dealing with the stress and trauma of his position. He's not alone: <em>The Pitt</em> delves into its characters' personal lives as well as the life-or-death decisions and day-to-day drama of the emergency room. </p><p>Where to stream: Max</p><h2 id="shifting-gears"><em>Shifting Gears</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Tim Allen returns to TV with <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0nYwN?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Shifting%20Gears&amp;short_url=a0nYwN&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Shifting Gears</em></a>, a throwback sitcom that's rife with snappy wisecracks and a laugh track from a live studio audience. I didn't think they <em>made</em> shows like this anymore. Allen plays Matt, the wisecracking owner of a classic car restoration shop. Kat Dennings plays his wisecracking, estranged daughter who moves back to Matt's home with her wisecracking children in tow. </p><p>Where to stream: Hulu</p><h2 id="on-call"><em>On Call</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Police procedural series have been a staple of television since <em>Dragne</em>t premiered in 1951 for good reason: What's more dramatic than good guys chasing bad guys? <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41vrk?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=On%20Call&amp;short_url=Q41vrk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>On Call</em></a> makes a classic cop show set-up (a veteran Long Beach, Calif. police officer teams up with an idealistic, wet-behind-the-ears rookie) more visceral and immediate by presenting the action through footage shot on dashcams, bodycams, smartphones, and security cameras. Joe Friday probably wouldn't approve of <em>On Call</em>'s v&eacute;rit&eacute; style, but it's an interesting new wrinkle in the genre.</p><p>Where to stream: Prime</p><h2 id="doc"><em>Doc</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-IKRZu3XqRoA"></div>
</div>


<p>The "doc" at the center of this medical series is Dr. Amy Larsen. Played by Molly Parker, Larsen is the chief of internal medicine at Minneapolis's Westside Hospital. The twist that separates <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXLdL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Doc&amp;short_url=aoXLdL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Doc</em></a> from other doctor shows is that Larsen was in a traumatic car accident that wiped her memory of the last eight years. She's still a good doctor, though, and continues treating patients while trying to piece her lost years back together.  It's an intriguing concept, and medical shows are TV staples for a reason, so this one deserves a watch. </p><p>Where to stream: Hulu</p><h2 id="american-primeval"><em>American Primeval</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-nSyLYlTuktc"></div>
</div>


<p>This limited series takes viewers back to an 1857, and explores the explosive collision of culture, religion, and community that gave birth the American West. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXqlA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=American%20Primeval&amp;short_url=9wXqlA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>American Primeval</em></a> doesn't shy away from the darkness and despair of history as its characters fight for survival and control in a lawless, brutal frontier. The cast includes Taylor Kitsch as Isaac Reed, a broken man intent on self-destruction, and Kim Coates as Mormon leader Brigham Young, who uses his personal army, the Nauvoo Legion, to keep his followers alive at any cost. </p><p>Where to stream: Netflix</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmXv4J?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Back%20in%20Action&amp;short_url=QmXv4J&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Back in Action</em></a>, the star power is turned up past 11. This action-comedy stars Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz as CIA agents who left the undercover life to raise a family together. But when their cover is blown, these seemingly normal parents come out of retirement to kick ass, take names, and make jokes. It's been over a decade since Diaz has appeared in a feature, so expect something special.</p><p>Where to stream: Netflix</p><h2 id="unstoppable"><em>Unstoppable</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-fxEEdR2ZTDw"></div>

<p>Jennifer Lopez anchors this inspiring story based on the real life of one-legged wrestler Anthony Robles, played by Jharrel Jerome. In <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YpgV?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Unstoppable&amp;short_url=a5YpgV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>, Lopez plays Anthony's mother Judy, one of those devoted movie moms who will not let her son give up on his dream of becoming a college wrestling champion, no matter how many sacrifices she has to make.

    <div id="video-container-_9CmC5Rmsdw&amp;"></div>
</div>


<p>If you like your comedy pitch black and shot through with absurdity and social commentary, <em>A Different Man</em> is the movie for you. Sebastian Stan plays Edward, a struggling actor with an extreme facial deformity. A medical procedure transforms him into a handsome dude&mdash;a different man&mdash;but he's only pretty on the outside. Edward soon learns that beauty is skin deep, but ugliness can go right down to the marrow. Like just about everything released by A24, <em>A Different Man</em> received <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_different_man" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">well-deserved raves</a> from critics. </p><p>Where to stream: Max</p><h2 id="henry-danger-the-movie"><em>Henry Danger: The Movie</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Rcc9veq0JgM"></div>
</div>


<p>Henry Danger returns to TV in this straight-to-streaming-and-basic-cable feature. It's been five years since the final season of Nickelodeon's <em>Henry Danger</em> TV show, and you gotta wonder if the show's original audience aged out of fandom. Whatever, though: there will always be kids and tweens into a superhero that isn't dark and broody. Here, Danger teams up with a superfan to explore an alternative dimension which could trap the pair forever. </p><p>Where to stream: Paramount+</p><h2 id="hereditary-2018"><em>Hereditary</em> (2018) </h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

</div>


<p>I love horror movies, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbl2b?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hereditary&amp;short_url=aAbl2b&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Hereditary</em></a> is the best one that been made in the last decade, at least. Ari Aster's masterpiece is not a movie for the faint of heart. It's legitimately disturbing in a primal way, a carefully paced, slow burn of dread that becomes builds to a shocking conclusion. The cast is amazing, but Toni Collette's portrayal of a mother struggling with mental illness stands out as one of the most unsettling performances in horror movie history. </p><p>Where to stream: Netflix</p><h2 id="last-weeks-picks">Last week's picks</h2><h2 id="flow-2024"><em>Flow</em> (2024)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-82WW9dVbglI"></div>
</div>


<p>If you're anything like me, you missed French film <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrXjYn?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Flow&amp;short_url=QrXjYn&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Flow</em></a> at Cannes and during its limited theatrical run in 2024. We should both be ashamed of ourselves. This breathtakingly beautiful animated adventure story about animals who must work together is exactly the kind of movie we both <em>like</em>. We're not alone, either: <em>Flow</em> earned a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flow_2024" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">97% positive critical rating and 99% positive audience rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes. So let's treat ourselves better in the future, and start with watching <em>Flow</em>, all right?</p><p>Where to stream: VOD</p><h2 id="jerry-springer-fights-camera-action"><em>Jerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-0VbMrWeppsI"></div>
</div>


<p>If you wanted to pinpoint the moment Western Culture fell off the cliff that led to (<em>gesturing vaguely at everything</em>) this, the popularity of <em>The Jerry Springer Show </em>is a solid contender. Through interviews with the people responsible and plenty of footage from the show, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Rk8P?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Jerry%20Springer%3A%20Fights%2C%20Camera%2C%20Action&amp;short_url=z3Rk8P&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>Jerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action</em></a> takes viewers behind-the-scenes of the Chicago-based talk show that built an empire on fistfights and scandals, both in front of and behind the camera. </p><p>Where to stream: Netflix</p><h2 id="stopmotion-2023"><em>Stopmotion</em> (2023)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Debr5KI1QIU"></div>
</div>


<p>A tortured artist whose most disturbing creations become real isn't the most original plot in horror movie history, but if it ain't broke, why fix it? The art in this case is stop-motion animation, the creepiest kind of animation, and the creation that comes to life, The Ash Man, is a stop motion figure made of raw steak and roadkill, so it's going to get <em>grisly</em>.  <em>Stopmotion</em> was written and directed by acclaimed stop motion animator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morgan_(filmmaker)" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Robert Morgan</a>, so the details are spot-on. </p><p>Where to stream: Hulu</p><h2 id="look-into-my-eyes"><em>Look Into My Eyes</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-mBM7lIMxTe8"></div>
</div>


<p>I'm inclined to think of "psychics" as cynical ghouls who exploit grief for profit, but <em>Look into My Eyes</em>' director Lana Wilson has a more nuanced view of the craft. Her documentary examines the relationship between small-time, New York psychics and their clients without weighing in on whether the mediums' claims are true. Instead of exploitation, Wilson finds healing, faith, and human connection. No matter how skeptical you are, it's a fascinating take on the subject. </p><p>Where to stream: Max</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the term is trending on TikTok (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-happens-after-tiktok-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">RIP</a>), it's a fresh spin on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/better-organize-your-days-with-timeboxing-1850652085#:~:text=Time%20blocking%20is%20the%20act,way%20a%20Google%20Calendar%20looks." target="_blank">established time-blocking techniques</a>. But there's something powerful about naming this dedicated time for facing our fears&mdash;it acknowledges that these tasks are indeed scary, and that's okay.</p><h2 id="my-financial-scary-hour-approach">My financial Scary Hour approach</h2><p>I started implementing this Scary Hour for my finances after realizing I had a growing pile of "I'll deal with that later" money tasks. Hey, there's nothing like writing about personal finance all day to make you procrastinate your own personal finances. Here's how I structure my financial Scary Hour:</p><ul><li><p>I schedule it for Tuesday mornings, when my energy is high and my mind is already in productivity mode from starting the work week</p></li><li><p>My phone goes on Do Not Disturb</p></li><li><p>I make <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXbrE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=my%20favorite%20ginger%20tea&amp;short_url=avXbrE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">my favorite ginger tea</a> (a small reward helps!)</p></li><li><p>I keep a physical notepad handy for action items</p></li><li><p>I set a timer for exactly 60 minutes</p></li></ul><h2 id="what-i-actually-do-during-scary-hour">What I actually do during Scary Hour</h2><p>In my first session, I tackled the immediate anxiety-inducing tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Reviewed all account balances</p></li><li><p>Categorized last month's "miscellaneous" purchases</p></li><li><p>Called about an incorrect charge I'd been avoiding (I had accidentally overpaid my credit card and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-you-should-overpay-your-credit-card-1850767094" target="_blank">created a negative balance</a>)</p></li><li><p>Finally calculated my true monthly restaurant spending (ouch!)</p></li></ul><p>You can work on your deeper financial planning, too:</p><ul><li><p>Reviewing and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/when-to-rebalance-your-investment-portfolio" target="_blank">adjusting investment</a> allocations</p></li><li><p>Comparing <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/what-homeowners-insurance-covers-how-much-you-need" target="_blank">insurance quotes</a></p></li><li><p>Reading through employee benefits documentation</p></li><li><p>Creating <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt#:~:text=The%20debt%20avalanche%20method,money%20until%20it's%20paid%20off." target="_blank">debt payoff</a> scenarios</p></li><li><p>Analyzing spending patterns in traditionally "scary" categories</p></li></ul><h2 id="why-this-productivity-hack-works">Why this productivity hack works</h2><p>The beauty of Scary Hour lies in its constraints. Knowing I only have to face these tasks for 60 minutes makes them feel manageable. Plus, the timer creates a sense of urgency that helps overcome analysis paralysis&mdash;a common obstacle I know I face in all things financial decision-making.</p><p>Most importantly, this approach creates a dedicated space for financial self-care. Not only do you get to reduce anxiety by making scary tasks routine, but you can actually turn scary tasks into small wins. If you're looking to transform vague money worries into concrete actions, this is the hack for you.</p><h2 id="tips-for-your-own-financial-scary-hour">Tips for your own financial Scary Hour</h2><p>Begin with quick wins like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-online-even-when-the-compa-1850117577" target="_blank">unsubscribing</a> from tempting retail emails, making that one phone call you've been avoiding, checking the balance on a neglected account, or filing away important financial documents. </p><p>From these bite-sized action items, you can build yourself a little momentum. As you get comfortable, tackle bigger tasks, like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/seven-ways-budget-and-how-to-pick-the-best-one-for-you" target="_blank">creating a new budget</a>, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/how-and-when-to-consolidate-your-credit-card-debt" target="_blank">consolidating debt</a>, or maybe even researching <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-talk-to-parents-about-estate-plan" target="_blank">estate planning</a>.</p><p>Make this habit sustainable by keeping a running list of tasks for future scary hours. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and be easy on yourself if you miss a week. After all, I find the real magic happens outside of Scary Hour. By regularly facing financial fears in a controlled setting, you'll likely find that money matters become less scary overall. I've noticed myself making quicker financial decisions, feeling more confident in money conversations, and experiencing less anxiety about day-to-day money management.</p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>Money <a href="https://lifehacker.com/take-these-steps-to-heal-your-relationship-with-money-1850269034" target="_blank">doesn't have to be scary</a> all the time. By dedicating just one hour a week to facing financial fears, you can transform anxiety into action. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate financial stress completely&mdash;it's to build the confidence to handle it effectively.</p><p>Start your own financial Scary Hour this week. Your future self will thank you for facing those fears, one hour at a time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Clean Up After You Spot Mice, Roaches, and Other Pests</title>

      <description>Pests aren't just pesky—they can also have a negative effect on your health.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHRCTX8CTXP8HW66KA9EGT8G/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>I have lived in New York City for 15 years now and in that time, I have occupied some truly horrific apartments, as broke post-grads are known to do. In that time, I have battled <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-keep-mice-out-of-your-house-this-winter-1850921825" target="_blank">mice</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-move-without-taking-roaches-and-other-pests-wi-1849405257" target="_blank">roaches</a>&mdash;and crucially, I have emerged victorious from these battles. If and when you see a mouse&mdash;which can happen to even the cleanest, most careful person&mdash;your first thought may simply be about how to get it the hell out of your house. </p><p>But after the shock wears off, you'll also need to think about cleaning. Once you've spotted a pest in your home, it's important to clean and get rid of anything that might attract more of its friends&mdash;but also specifically because some pests, like mice, can carry diseases or otherwise make your place unsanitary. </p><h2 id="how-to-clean-after-you-have-mice">How to clean after you have mice</h2><p>David Price, Associate Certified Entomologist and&nbsp;Director of Technical Services for <a href="https://mosquitojoe.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Mosquito Joe</a>, tells Lifehacker that cleaning is a key part of prevention, whether you just cleared an infestation or want to ward one off in the future. This means some bigger home maintenance tasks, like sealing gaps and cracks in your home's exterior with steel wool or caulk and keeping exterior grass trimmed and removing weeds&mdash;but it also means just keeping up with the small stuff, like cleaning up food spills quickly and not leaving pet food unattended.</p><p>Over the years, I've learned my own prevention techniques as an urban renter with little to no control over what, if anything, my building does to keep me mouse-free. I use airtight containers for all my foods, for instance. Mice are crafty and hungry, so a bag or cardboard box of food in the cupboard is nothing more than a little puzzle for them to eat right through. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXn5m?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=A%20set%20of%20four%20mouse-proof%20containers%2C%20like%20these%2C%20is%20around%20%2420&amp;short_url=9yXn5m&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">A set of four mouse-proof containers, like these, is around $20</a>. And when it comes to your pets, don't pile a bunch of food in their bowl and call it a day. Dole out small portions and remove what they leave every night. </p><p>As for post-mouse cleaning, you need to thoroughly disinfect every place they may have gone. Marla Mock, President of <a href="http://www.mollymaid.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Molly Maid</a>, says you should sanitize all counters, floors, and other surfaces, plus check areas where they might have hidden, like under appliances and inside cabinets. </p><p>Wear gloves and use a diluted bleach solution to sanitize these areas. If you find droppings, cover them in your diluted bleach solution for a few minutes before attempting to sweep them up. Mice also have a tendency to run next to baseboards and other low surfaces. You may see some greasy-looking streaks. These are nefarious, as other mice can see them and feel confident a peer was in that same location. Thoroughly bleach your baseboards and any low surfaces, like table legs or the bottoms of appliances. </p><h2 id="how-to-clean-after-a-roach-or-bug-infestation">How to clean after a roach or bug infestation</h2><p>Price, the bug expert, recommends removing any sources of standing water after getting rid of bugs. Without giving away too many personal details, I will say I learned the hard way two years ago that you can't just leave a leaky shower head alone because it's "not bothering" you. Any wetness can attract something that <em>will</em> bother you. You should also see any bug encounter as a sign to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/best-decluttering-methods" target="_blank">declutter your home</a>, since you want to lessen the amount of spaces they can hide. Again, prevention is important, so build the habit of wiping up any spill or food waste promptly. I also recommend having a sealed garbage can to prevent any enticing odors.  </p><p>Per Mock, once you've gotten rid of the bugs, you should deep clean your whole home by vacuuming, dusting, and wiping down all your furniture, floors, and baseboards, while paying special attention to corners, cracks, and crevices. Wash your bedding and linens in hot water, too, to kill bugs and their eggs, especially if you suspect bedbugs. (If you do suspect bedbugs, it's worth looking into <a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/do-it-yourself-bed-bug-control" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">more specific treatment methods</a>.)</p><h2 id="what-to-keep-in-mind-about-pests-and-cleaning">What to keep in mind about pests and cleaning</h2><p>First of all, if you see a mouse or a roach, don't get down on yourself. They're hungry and cold, like any creature, and they're following their instincts by trying to find somewhere safe to hang out and eat. It doesn't mean you're a slob or a disgrace; it just means they figured out a way in. You also can't control your building's pest prevention efforts, the cleanliness of your neighbors, or weather events that force critters that belong outside to run inside. Focus on what you can control, which is pest removal and future prevention. </p><p>"Most people do not think to start outside," says Price. "They tend to think it's only inside their home that's the issue. Most of the time, the infestation begins outside, whether that be from your trash or overgrown weeds, bushes, etc. It's important to tidy up your yard." </p><p>When you're looking for repellents, keep in mind that some are more serious than others. If you have pets, look for ones marked pet-friendly. If you're going to periodically spray with Raid, understand that it will drive bugs from their hiding places and, unfortunately, out into open spaces before it kills them. Spray before you leave the house for a long time, so you're not breathing it in, and prepare to clean up when you get home. </p><p>Finally, when you're cleaning, try to think like a pest. By that, I mean don't just clean what you can see. Pull things off shelves, get under appliances, and think of the locations that could be, as Mock calls them, "hidden spots." If you're nervous about doing that because, God forbid, you don't want to find a live bug, call a friend to help you. You can't just leave it alone and hope for the best. If you're really struggling to get the situation under control, call an exterminator and/or a house cleaning service&mdash;and let the cleaner know the deal in advance to make sure they're equipped to help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What to Expect From Samsung's Galaxy S25 Unpacked Stream</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHRKAKNZ470Y9F5ZV8Y9ZS4K</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked is less than a week away.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHRKAKNZ470Y9F5ZV8Y9ZS4K/hero-image.webp"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another year, another Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. The Android giant has gotten into a habit of hosting at least two of these events per year, one for foldables and one for pretty much everything else. With the foldables having <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-have-arrived" target="_blank"><u>gotten center stage last time</u></a>, it&rsquo;s likely time for the rest of its products, including the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, to get its turn. While only those under NDA know for sure what we&rsquo;ll see, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re expecting to see when the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">streams on January 22</a> at 1 PM ET.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-s25-and-s25-ultra">Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra</h2><p>Samsung likes to kick off each year by announcing its latest non-folding phones, and there&rsquo;s no reason to expect this year to be different. Typically, this means a standard variant, a larger screen &ldquo;plus&rdquo; size, and a more powerful &ldquo;ultra&rdquo; version. Given that Samsung has already registered three new model numbers with the FCC (thanks, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-fcc-certification/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>91Mobiles</u></a>), that&rsquo;s what we can expect this year, too (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-may-steal-the-show-at-unpacked-even-if-it-doesnt-release/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">prior leaks</a> had pointed at a "slim" model, although there's no FCC listing for it yet).</p><p>As for specs, that&rsquo;s where it gets a bit interesting. The biggest tidbit from the FCC leaks is potential support for 45W fast charging, although <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-design" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Android Headlines</u></a> claims to have pictures of the devices themselves. These show a move to rounded corners and thinner bezels, but the rest of the design looks largely untouched.</p><p>As for internals, leakers are expecting all S25 models to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which was <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/10/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-8-elite-with-the-world-s-fastest-mob" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>revealed in October</u></a> and stated to be coming to Samsung products. This tracks with prior Galaxy devices, which also used the same chip across all models, although details have differed from region to region before. Now, said regional differences are said to <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1856677902869516626" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>not be in play</u></a>.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite promises improvements anywhere from 35 to 62% depending on the task at hand, with the biggest improvement being to web browsing&mdash;key for a mobile phone.</p><p>Samsung phones are also known for their cameras, although both <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/12/galaxy-s25-ultras-camera-sensors.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Android Headlines</u></a> and popular leaker <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1833100800941519242" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Ice Universe</u></a> claim only the Galaxy S25 Ultra will see an improvement here, and only to its ultra-wide lens, which will go from 12MP to 50MP.</p><p>Screens are unlikely to change from their current OLED setup, and as for software, the phones are set to use Samsung&rsquo;s <a href="https://me.pcmag.com/en/mobile/27409/samsung-introduces-one-ui-7-beta-program-with-advanced-security-features" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>One UI 7</u></a>, which is already in beta and runs over Android 15. Also expect a bunch of AI-centric announcements, although solid leaks have yet to emerge there.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also potential accessory news on the horizon, as the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250106397777/en/Qi2%E2%80%99s-Wireless-Charging-Benefits-Spurring-Continued-Expansion" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Wireless Power Consortium</u></a> has said that Samsung will support Qi2 wireless charging on its new phones. According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1868996832376099265" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>chunvn8888</u></a>, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;ll have built-in magnets (which Qi2 supports), but Samsung will sell a case with a built-in magnetic ring.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</h2><p>News on the <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241225PD216/samsung-galaxy-ar-smart-glasses-2025.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Galaxy Ring 2</u></a> is a bit less clear, but hit-or-miss Taiwanese publication DigiTimes says Samsung might tease it during the event. The publication is expecting two additional sizes, updated sensors, and new AI features, but given that the first model launched in July, it&rsquo;ll likely be some time until you can buy a follow up. However, <a href="https://blog.naver.com/yeux1122/223648855900" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Korean leaker Lanzuk</u></a> says Samsung might launch the wearable a bit earlier than expected.</p><h2 id="samsung-ar-and-xr">Samsung AR and XR</h2><p>Finally, it&rsquo;s possible we&rsquo;ll hear more about Samsung&rsquo;s augmented and extended reality initiatives. Samsung has previously announced an Android-based extended reality headset alongside Google called <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/unlock-the-infinite-possibilities-of-xr-with-galaxy-ai" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Project Moohan</u></a>, so it&rsquo;s possible the company might demo it during Unpacked, but don&rsquo;t expect it to be available right away. Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-xr/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>still seeding developers</u></a> with software and equipment for the new platform, although the company does say it expects Moohan to start selling by the end of the year.</p><p>On that note, also don&rsquo;t expect to see anything substantive regarding Samsung&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>previously confirmed AR glasses</u></a>. DigiTimes says the glasses will look fairly unassuming, but given that they&rsquo;ll also rely on Google tech, they&rsquo;re probably still in the oven as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Follow a Training Program for a Marathon or Half Marathon, Even When Nothing Is Going Right</title>

      <description>What to do if you miss a week, have an extra week, can’t get this week’s long run in, and more.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J8QY665P2HF3NR59C8JFY8S9/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&rsquo;re training for a race, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-a-marathon-training-program-1850819139" target="_blank"><u>a good training plan is key</u></a>. With that training program, you&rsquo;ll have all your runs planned out for you, with just the right mix of long runs, speed work, and easy mileage to get you to the start line strong and ready. But what do you do when the plan doesn&rsquo;t match up with your life? You get sick and miss a week, or you realize too late you started on the wrong date. Or maybe the plan calls for something you just can&rsquo;t make happen on schedule, like a tune-up race.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I do???&rdquo; I hear you wailing. Well, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do: you do your best to follow the plan without letting any feelings of guilt or nervousness take over. Missed workouts are in the past, and you&rsquo;ll move on without trying to make them up. For the most part, anyway. Let&rsquo;s look at a few scenarios where you might have questions. But first&mdash;let&rsquo;s zoom out so we can see the big picture.</p><h2 id="understand-what-your-training-plan-is-trying-to-do">Understand what your training plan is trying to do</h2><p>Before we can talk about whether to do this or that run off-schedule, we need to get our bearings and understand what each part of the training plan is trying to do. I&rsquo;m going to describe the phases in a typical marathon training program, which will apply to most hard training programs, including those for half marathons.&nbsp;There are a few different phases over the course of what's usually a 12- to 18-week plan, and they're laid out something like this:</p><h3>The beginning, or base</h3><p><strong>What it is: </strong>Several weeks where you run a similar number of miles per week to what you were used to doing before you started this program. During this on-ramp phase, the program will challenge you to keep a consistent training routine and add some extra distance to your long runs and perhaps some extra speed work or strength training that you had previously been neglecting. This may or may not feel like its own phase; it may just be the beginning of the build.&nbsp;(On the flip side, it's possible to have several months of base building before your plan transitions you into the build. This is common if you're using a long term plan, like the kind you get from an app or wearable <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-train-for-a-race-with-garmins-training-plans" target="_blank">like a Garmin</a> if you put in a race date that is far in the future.) </p><p><strong>How you&rsquo;ll feel: </strong>You&rsquo;ll feel pretty good during this phase.</p><p><strong>Your biggest priority in this phase</strong>: Sticking to the program and preparing for the work to come.</p><h3>The build</h3><p><strong>What it is: </strong>A nice long stretch focused on building up your mileage, both in the length of the long run and in total weekly mileage. This is the longest phase of the program, perhaps six to eight weeks long.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How you&rsquo;ll feel:</strong> You&rsquo;ll experience some fatigue, sore muscles, and maybe some blisters or minor injuries&mdash;but these tend to be pretty mild and overall you&rsquo;re feeling OK.</p><p><strong>Your biggest priority in this phase</strong>: Keeping up with the increases and taking care of your body (good <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/carbs-are-good-actually" target="_blank">nutrition</a>, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-you-really-need-to-replace-your-running-shoes-acc-1848654849" target="_blank">shoes</a>, etc.) so that you can stay healthy and keep training.</p><h3>The peak</h3><p><strong>What it is: </strong>This is the three to four weeks or so when mileage is highest, workouts are hardest, and the fatigue is really starting to catch up with you. If it&rsquo;s a marathon program, you&rsquo;re probably doing some 18+ mile long runs. If your race is a half marathon or less, you may be doing long runs that are <em>longer</em> than your race.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How you&rsquo;ll feel</strong>: Somewhere between &ldquo;pretty rough, but hanging in there&rdquo; and &ldquo;frankly, I feel like shit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your biggest priority in this phase</strong>: Surviving.</p><h3>The taper</h3><p><strong>What it is: </strong>After all that hard work, you finally get a break. The long runs are suddenly a lot shorter, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself running a lot less mileage than you were during the peak. This phase is often about three weeks long for a marathon, and one to two weeks for a half marathon. For shorter races it may be just a few easy days so you can rest up before race day.</p><p><strong>How you&rsquo;ll feel</strong>: Often this is when you feel the worst, because all of that fatigue has built up, but you haven&rsquo;t had enough of a break yet to feel rested. It&rsquo;s also <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-survive-the-marathon-taper-1850945224" target="_blank"><u>very normal to go a little crazy</u></a> as you start wondering whether your training was <em>really</em> good enough and whether you&rsquo;re <em>really</em> ready for your race. But this is all part of the plan, and if you stick with it you&rsquo;ll feel like a million bucks on race day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your biggest priority in this phase</strong>: Recovery. Or to put it another way: following the damn program, and <em>not</em> giving in to the temptation to go run an extra 20-miler or a race-pace workout &ldquo;just to be sure&rdquo; that you can.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="general-rules-for-modifying-your-training-program-when-life-intervenes">General rules for modifying your training program when life intervenes</h2><p>With those phases in mind, it becomes a lot easier to figure out what to do when something messes with your schedule. Here are some very general rules to follow in every phase:</p><ul><li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s OK to rearrange workouts within a week</strong>. For example, if you can&rsquo;t do your long run on Saturday, go ahead and move it to Friday or Sunday.&nbsp;(Get in the habit of looking at your schedule at the beginning of each week so you can plan ahead.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritize your &ldquo;key&rdquo; workouts</strong> (long runs, speed work) and try not to miss those. If you have to miss a run for scheduling/life reasons, make the one you drop an easy run.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t try to make up missed runs</strong>, especially if you were sick and/or had to miss multiple sessions. Pick up where you left off. And give yourself some grace those first few days back&mdash;take it easy and do what you can.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure the program ends on race day</strong>. The taper works genuine magic if you time it right, and the peak is what sets up the taper. Don&rsquo;t mess with the timing of those last few weeks.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Nobody&rsquo;s perfect</strong>. If you manage to do 90% of the program as written, you&rsquo;re still 100% on track and you&rsquo;ll do great at the race.</p></li></ul><p>Got it? Now let&rsquo;s tackle some specific questions. These are all taken from running forums, subreddits, and coaches&rsquo; anecdotes about what questions they get most often.&nbsp;A coach or experienced friend is the best resource, since they know you and you can discuss the specifics of your situation, but if you're just looking for general advice, here goes:</p><h2 id="how-bad-is-it-to-miss-a-run-on-your-training-program">How bad is it to miss a run on your training program? </h2><p>Look, there's a reason your training program lasts 12 weeks or whatever. It's because no <em>single</em> run is going to prepare you for a marathon. That also means no single run is going to ruin your fitness just because you missed it. <strong>It is OK to miss a run sometimes</strong>. If it's one of your short or easy runs, your fitness won't really suffer at all. Even if it's a long run or an important workout, it's not the end of the world to miss one or two of those. </p><p>Think of the runs as like money you're putting into a piggy bank. If you aim to put in $5 a week, and you miss putting in a penny here or there, it's not a big deal. But if you're consistently totaling $4 rather than $5, you'll come up short in the end. It's more important to be consistent than to worry about one day's individual contribution. </p><p>Sometimes you're missing a run for a good reason, anyway. You got sick and now you're recovering. Or you had a vacation and you took some time off and enjoyed yourself for once. The benefit of missing that run is arguably more valuable than the training you would have gotten by doing it. </p><h2 id="i-started-the-program-too-early-and-now-i-have-extra-time-to-fill-should-i-repeat-some-of-the-weeks">I started the program too early, and now I have extra time to fill. Should I repeat some of the weeks?</h2><p>That depends on where you are in the program. <em>Do not</em> repeat weeks in the taper. That&rsquo;s meant to be a short, sharp decrease in mileage. Stretching it out will rob it of its power. (Tapers are magic, I swear.)&nbsp;</p><p>You also <em>do not</em> want to repeat hard weeks in the peak. Remember, that&rsquo;s the highest fatigue part of the program, and you&rsquo;re just trying to hang in there and not let it kill you. If the program is designed to have one 20-mile training run, it is foolishness to try to run two in a row.&nbsp;</p><p>(There are, of course, exceptions to these rules. Some people might benefit from a longer taper, or have the fitness to do an extra long run and recover from it without too much trouble. But I&rsquo;m trying to keep my advice general, and <em>most</em> people who say &ldquo;fuck it, I&rsquo;ll do an extra long run&rdquo; will end up regretting it.)</p><p>So what can you do? I&rsquo;d recommend these approaches, in this order of preference:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Extend the beginning or build phases</strong>. You can certainly repeat week five of a 16-week program, no sweat. Feel free to make the repeated week(s) slightly different, maybe decreasing the long run by a mile or two, or doing hills instead of track repeats. Just try to keep it within the spirit of what that phase of training is trying to accomplish. </p></li><li><p><strong>Add cutback weeks during the peak or late build phases</strong>. If you&rsquo;re already in the peak phase when you notice your scheduling mishap, add an easy week in between some of the hard weeks. For example, the <a href="https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/levelthree" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Level 3 Boston Marathon program</u></a> has a 17-20 mile run in week 16, followed by 18-20 in week 17. You could insert a week in between where your long run is 13 miles or so to give you a little bit of a break. Or say you&rsquo;re following a <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Hal Higdon program</u></a> that alternates between 20-mile and 12-mile long runs during the peak. Add an extra repeat of that cycle, maybe doing 16 or 18 rather than another 20-miler (since multiple 20s is <em>a lot</em>), and following it with a 12 according to the pattern.</p></li></ol><p>When in doubt, make the added week <em>easier</em> than the weeks before and after it. Your body will appreciate the extra recovery.</p><h2 id="what-if-i-dont-have-a-tune-up-race-to-run">What if I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;tune-up race&rdquo; to run?&nbsp;</h2><p>Some training plans will throw in a race partway through the program. (Our resident marathoner Meredith Dietz <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-make-the-most-of-racing-during-marathon-training" target="_blank">explains the rationale here</a>.) A marathon program might have you race a half marathon in the middle of your training. A half marathon might have you race a 10K.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, this will be an actual race. You&rsquo;ll sign up for the My Town 10K and have to figure out all your race day logistics: how early to wake up, what to eat, whether you want to carry your phone, and so on. You&rsquo;ll also have the pressure of a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/which-should-you-believe-after-a-race-official-time-or-watch" target="_blank"><u>timed course</u></a> (no free pauses for water breaks) and the adrenaline rush of a crowd cheering you on.&nbsp;</p><p>Having to deal with all that bullshit is half the point of doing a tune-up race. The other half is getting a chance to see how fast you can <em>really</em> run, and then you can use that result to help you decide what pace to target for your big race. (Plug in your race time <a href="https://vdoto2.com/calculator/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">here</a> to see your predicted times at other distances.) </p><p>But maybe there isn&rsquo;t a 10K in your town that weekend. Here are, in my opinion, your best options:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Find a race of the correct (or similar) distance on a different weekend</strong>. Usually this isn&rsquo;t a part of the training program where the timing is super critical. If you can get the full race day experience a week or two earlier or later, go ahead and swap things around to make that happen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Run a time trial. </strong>This is just a race that you do on your own. There won&rsquo;t be a crowd or a bib pickup table, but you can still test your fitness over the programmed distance. Reward yourself with a stale post-race bagel for verisimilitude.</p></li><li><p><strong>Just do a regular long run. </strong>Usually the tune-up race takes the place of your weekend long run. Look at the weeks before and after it on the calendar, and ask yourself &ldquo;if there wasn&rsquo;t a race here, what would it be instead?&rdquo; Make your best guess, and then do that.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h2 id="what-if-i-want-to-add-a-race-thats-not-on-the-program">What if I want to add a race that's not on the program?&nbsp;</h2><p>This is the opposite of the dilemma above. There <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a race scheduled, but you want to do one anyway. Your friend is running a 5K and you'd like to join them, or some other scenario where you&rsquo;ll be running, but not hitting the programmed distance.</p><p>The simplest answer is just: run a <em>loooong</em> warmup and cooldown. Three real easy miles before the 5K shouldn&rsquo;t ruin the race for you; in fact, you&rsquo;ll probably feel nicely warmed up by the time you get to the start line. And then you can do the other six miles as an extended cooldown.&nbsp;</p><p>Same idea if you&rsquo;re meeting a friend for a run. If they want to do a nice easy five-miler, you can do seven before they show up, run your last five with them, and then go to brunch together.&nbsp;</p><p>If the race is a longer one&mdash;say, a 10K&mdash;you can also just treat it as a tune-up race. Run it all-out, and don&rsquo;t bother making up the mileage. Depending on where you are in the program, a race <em>and</em> a long run might be too much to recover from.&nbsp;</p><p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want to do this <em>every</em> week, but once or twice in your training plan isn&rsquo;t the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="i-missed-my-longest-run-and-now-its-taper-time-should-i-squeeze-in-a-20-miler-real-quick">I missed my longest run, and now it&rsquo;s taper time! Should I squeeze in a 20-miler real quick?&nbsp;</h2><p>You know the answer to this one by now: no. The taper is for recovery. Also, my god, you have <em>no idea</em> how many people miss their last 20-miler and then do absolutely fine at their marathon.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="i-ran-all-my-long-runs-but-some-of-them-went-really-badly-i-think-i-can-redo-my-last-16-miler-but-do-it-better-this-time-how-do-i">I ran all my long runs, but some of them went really badly. I think I can redo my last 16-miler, but do it better this time. How do I&mdash;</h2><p>That's the neat thing, you don't. </p><h2 id="what-if-i-am-a-special-snowflake-and-believe-these-rules-dont-apply-to-me">What if I am a special snowflake and believe these rules don&rsquo;t apply to me?&nbsp;</h2><p>Honestly: maybe you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;A cookie-cutter program is not guaranteed to be perfect for everyone. Just promise me something: whatever &ldquo;bad&rdquo; decisions you make, <em>learn from them</em>. Maybe you think you&rsquo;ll be fine with a shorter taper. If you truly want to test that hypothesis, shorten your taper! Keep notes. And then see how you do in the race.&nbsp;</p><p>Just remember that this kind of self-experimentation works best if you do the program as written your first time around, and then tweak it when you run your next race. You&rsquo;re learning how you respond to training, which is an incredibly valuable skill as you grow as an athlete.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>All the Apps ByteDance Operates in the US</title>

      <description>It's not just TikTok.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR8EP8KMXHAEVWPY52JJADD/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok is facing an imminent ban in the United States. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-ban-news" target="_blank">Following the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the law banning the app</a>, there are fewer options than ever to avoid losing TikTok in the US. Unless President-elect Trump steps in, or an act of Congress extends the timeline, TikTok will go dark on Sunday.   </p><p>The thing is, ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, owns and operates other apps within the U.S. None of these apps are currently in talks to be banned, but they all should, in theory, have many of the same concerns that caused the government to go after TikTok. ByteDance is based in China, and, as such, would be beholden to the Chinese government should the latter ask for the data of any American users.</p><p>In fact, the law that sets TikTok on the course to be banned on Sunday makes it clear no ByteDance app is safe. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">At the top of the law</a>, it says the act's goal is, "To protect the national security of the United States from the threat posed by foreign adversary controlled applications, such as TikTok and any successor application or service and any other application or service developed or provided by ByteDance Ltd. or an entity under the control of ByteDance Ltd."</p><p>The following is every app ByteDance and its subsidiaries currently operate in the U.S. that I could find. As such, it is possible that each is in danger of a future ban, at least under the current law&mdash;though some are likely smaller targets than others. </p><h2 id="tiktok">TikTok</h2><p>This is the big one: ByteDance, of course, owns TikTok, the app at the center of all this national security drama. You might be addicted to the app yourself. </p><p>What you might not know, however, is that the TikTok we know started out life not as a ByteDance property, nor as "TikTok" itself; rather, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-parents-need-to-know-about-musical-ly-1827629231" target="_blank">the app was originally called Musical.ly</a>, and was designed for users to post short videos lip-syncing to popular songs. It amassed a large following, which caught ByteDance's attention, just as it had its sights set on expanding its short-form social media app, Douyin, globally. ByteDance went international with a new version of Douyin, TikTok, in 2017, and almost immediately after, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lip-syncing-app-musical-ly-is-acquired-for-as-much-as-1-billion-1510278123" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">acquired Musical.ly for nearly $1 billion</a>.    </p><p>The rest, of course, is history. TikTok has become a world-wide phenomenon, capturing the attentions of one billion users. 170 million of those users happen to be in the U.S., which makes you wonder how a looming ban of the app&nbsp;will affect TikTok's bottom line. </p><h2 id="tiktok-lite">TikTok Lite</h2><p>If you have an Android device, you might have seen <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiktok.lite.go" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TikTok Lite</a> before. This app is TikTok, only a lighter, more streamlined version. Like other "lite" apps, this one is designed for phones with limited RAM, data, or unstable connections. </p><p>TikTok Lite is not that popular, especially when compared to TikTok proper. It only has 100,000 downloads compared to TikTok's more than one billion. It gets left out of the ban discussion, but if I had to guess, I would say ByteDance would cut service to TikTok Lite in addition to the main TikTok app.  </p><h2 id="tiktok-studio-and-tiktok-shop-seller">TikTok Studio and TikTok Shop Seller</h2><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.tt.creator" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TikTok Studio</a> isn't made for consumers. Rather, it's an app for TikTok creators to manage posts on their accounts. Similarly, there's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiktokshop.seller" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TikTok Shop Seller Center</a>, an app for users who sell products on TikTok to manage their digital shops.  </p><p>These apps are likely convenient for these users now, but who would want to use them if TikTok itself is gone?</p><h2 id="capcut">CapCut</h2><p>In the past, if you wanted to get into video production, you need to spend quite a bit of money: You needed a camera, a computer, and editing software, none of which came cheap, and most of which required a good deal of technical know-how. These days, anyone with a smartphone can make videos. Many of us interested in doing so have turned to CapCut, which just so happens to be owned by none other than ByteDance. </p><p>To say CapCut is popular is a wild understatement. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The app has over a billion downloads on Android alone</a>, and is also available on iOS, Mac, Windows, and even on the web. Like other video editors, CapCut offers tools for chopping up your clips into content to post on your socials, but there are a number of extra features available as well. That includes templates to get a part of your video started, video effects, AI features, music integration, stock videos, and more.  </p><p>All these features aside, the reason CapCut is so popular has likely just as much (if not more) to do with the fact that it is owned by the same parent company as TikTok. That means a few things: CapCut offers an easy workflow from editing to posting on TikTok; TikTokers use the app and promote it themselves; and ByteDance can advertise CapCut on TikTok as much as it wants. </p><h2 id="hypic">Hypic</h2><p>On the other side of the editing aisle, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xt.retouchoversea" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">there's Hypic</a>, ByteDance's photo editing tool. This app isn't nearly as big as CapCut, but it's still pretty large (over 10 million downloads on the Play Store). The app offers standard photo editing tools, but also other perks: There are AI-powered tools, such as cutouts, background removal, and filters; a feature that lets you add "trending" makeup to images; and other options, like stickers and templates.</p><h2 id="lemon8">Lemon8</h2><p>In protest of the government's potential ban on TikTok, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-rednote-or-xiaohongshu" target="_blank">users are flocking to other Chinese-based social media apps in protest</a>. One such app is <a href="https://www.lemon8-app.com/en-US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Lemon8</a>, a "lifestyle" social media platform. Like TikTok, Lemon8 also supports video sharing, but that's not its only focus. Users can also post images, including to carousels, offering an Instagram-like experience. Plus, you can engage with multiple types of content at the same time, akin to Pinterest. As Jessica Maddox, associate professor of digital media technology, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tiktok-pushes-users-sister-app-lemon8-ahead-potential-ban-rcna187417" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">tells NBC News</a>, &ldquo;If those three apps came together and had a baby, it would be Lemon8." </p><h2 id="marvel-snap"><em>Marvel Snap</em></h2><p><a href="https://www.marvelsnap.com/home" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><em>Marvel Snap</em></a> is a popular mobile card game, incorporating character from the Marvel universe. <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/a-starter-guide-on-how-to-play-marvel-snap" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Players draw decks of 12 cards</a>, and play for control of three locations. Whichever player controls at least two locations after six turns wins. While Marvel itself might be an American property, the game is operated by Nuverse, a ByteDance subsidiary, which potentially places it in the crosshairs of the U.S. government.</p><h2 id="land-of-empires"><em>Land of Empires</em></h2><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasis.immortal" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><em>Land of Empires</em></a> is another game owned by Nuverse. This title is a strategy game that pits you against an enemy army of demons. Like other strategy games, you fortify your lands, fight enemies in combat, and engage in large battles. It's not quite as popular as <em>Marvel Snap</em>, but it's not all that niche, either, sporting over a million downloads on the Play Store.  </p><h2 id="lark">Lark</h2><p>Chances are, you've never heard of Lark. (I certainly hadn't.) Lark offers a collection of business apps and services. The standalone Lark app for iOS and Android is described as a "team collaboration" app, which, for all intents and purposes, means its basically a Microsoft Teams or Slack competitor. Lark has features like in-app messaging and video calling, as well as collaborative document sharing. </p><p>This probably isn't something you'll ever use on your own, but rather a service you use through your company. Should the government's attention on ByteDance grow wider, however, your company may have to consider alternatives.  </p><h2 id="tokopedia-and-tokopedia-start">Tokopedia and Tokopedia START</h2><p><a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Tokopedia</a> is a shopping service based out of Indonesia, but it has apps available to users in the U.S. Also available from the company is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tokopedia-start/id1632881844" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Tokopedia START</a>, an app that appears to have been made for a 2022 tech conference. Tokopedia, as you may have guessed, is a subsidiary of ByteDance</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Often You Really Need to Wash Your Winter Coat</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">1849683582</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Plus, how to actually clean them.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2H97CXE4J1CPF0T7WPQ16K/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>We all have <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-often-should-you-wash-your-pillows-cushions-and-c-1849447049" target="">plenty of laundry</a> to do on a regular basis, so a seasonal item we wear less frequently may not work its way into our normal wash routine. How often, for example, do you think to wash your winter coat? No matter how you answer that&mdash;because, honestly, most people don't think about that one very frequently&mdash;let&rsquo;s look at how often you <em>should</em>. The answer depends on a few factors, including how often you wear each coat and the material it&rsquo;s made of.</p><h2 id="wash-wool-and-leather-coats-seasonally">Wash wool and leather coats&nbsp;seasonally</h2><p>Wool and leather coats should be cleaned once per season, provided they get less wear than your other coats. If you wear them often, opt for twice per season. So, wash it once around early November and again in late January to make sure it&rsquo;s clean enough to last through early March. Luckily, says Cheryl Nelson, a laundry pro and founder of <a href="http://PrepareWithCher.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PrepareWithCher.com</a>, wool naturally repels dirt and odors, so you can get away with slightly less frequent washing than other coats. For tips on cleaning leather and wool, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/8-of-the-hardest-to-clean-materials-and-how-to-care-fo-1849574636" target="">check out my guide here</a>.</p><p>Exercise caution, though: Wendy Saladyga, Fabric Care Expert and Manager of Technical Performance at Henkel for Persil, points out that while some wool coats are fine to wash in a machine, others are dry clean-only and if you accidentally wash non-washable wool, you could be left with irreversible shrinkage. Check your tag, please!</p><h2 id="wash-fleece-jackets-more-frequently">Wash fleece jackets more frequently</h2><p>Fleece jackets should be washed every few wears, says Saladyga. If you wear yours every day, do it every week. You can get five or six wears out of one, but anything after that is dicier. (Of course, if you notice them getting dirty faster, wash them sooner than that.) Don&rsquo;t iron them and be sure to dry fleece jackets on a line to keep them soft and fluffy.</p><h2 id="rain-jackets-need-more-regular-cleaning">Rain jackets need more regular cleaning</h2><p>Rain jackets should be cleaned regularly, since you only wear those when the weather is bad. If you live in a rainy area, opt for a twice-a-month wash schedule. Otherwise, clean them once per month (as long as you actually wore it that month, which you might not if you don't live in a very wet climate). Make sure the jacket is zipped up when you wash it, wash it per the instructions on the tag, and finish it off with a waterproof coating or repellant after you dry it. I have a complete guide on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-detergent-on-your-rain-gear-do-this-instead-1850037456" target="_blank">washing raincoats here</a>, since it's actually a pretty involved process.

<h2 id="down-coats-are-similar-to-wool-ones">Down coats are similar to wool ones</h2><p>You might think that because the fluffy, absorbent parts of your down coat are tucked away within a repellant surface, you're safer here&mdash;but these still need regular washing. Nelson says the filling can still trap oils and odors inside, which means that if this is your daily-wear coat, you need to wash it pretty often. You want to wash down coats as frequently as other coats, so twice per season at least. You do want this to be a gentle process, however, so don&rsquo;t use a washing machine with an agitator. Use a gentle detergent&mdash;ideally one designed for down coats&mdash;and dry it on a low heat. Toss in some dryer balls to fluff it back up while it dries, Nelson says, but remove it while it&rsquo;s still a bit damp and hang it to dry the rest of the way.</p><h2 id="general-coat-cleaning-basics">General coat-cleaning basics</h2><p>No matter what kind of coat you have, there are some general rules to follow for cleaning. Saladyga says that at the very least, you have to wash it once per season, but you also need to spot clean any time you get the coat dirty. </p><p>A great time to wash the coat, according to both Saladyga and Nelson, is right before you put it in storage at the <em>end</em> of winter, so it maintains its appearance better and is ready when you need it next year. Dirt and oils can set in deeper if left on the fabric while it's in storage. Plus, Nelson says, "The last thing you want is to drop your coat off at the dry cleaner and then not have it during a late-season cold snap." </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Like all OLEDs, be mindful that its brightness will not be as good as QLEDs or LEDs. If your setup is in a bright room, make sure you have shades if you want to see the full effect of an OLED.</p><p>The Sony A75L OLED came out in 2023 as a new entry-level OLED TV with many of the features you'd want from a premium TV, especially for gamers. Although you only get one HDMI 2.1 (apart from the second one which doubles as the eARC port, which isn't a problem unless you want to hook up a sound system), the A75L has VRR support, bandwidth for up to 4K at 120Hz, low input lag in Game Mode of 9.2 ms, and clear motion with little blur, all which combine to make an excellent gaming OLED TV.</p><p>Casual streamers will enjoy the Cognitive Processor XR, which upscales low-resolution content very well (great if you're not paying for 4K Netflix). I really like the Google TV smart platform, mainly because of the user-friendliness and that it lets me cast my phone or laptop without an external device. The viewing angle and reflection handling on the A75L are top-tier as well, allowing people to view from the far end of the couch.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If you're like me, there are people you want to follow in all three places.</p><p>Luckily, there are ways to do this. We've talked about <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-bridgy-feed-to-link-mastodon-and-bluesky" target="_blank">how to connect Mastodon and Bluesky</a>, and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-enable-fediverse-sharing-on-threads" target="_blank">how to follow Threads users from Mastodon</a>. Both of those solutions, however, depend on the people you want to follow actively enabling or setting up an integration, and even then only kind of work. <a href="https://openvibe.social/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">OpenVibe</a> is, for most people, a better answer at this point.</p><p>This free application for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/openvibe-to-nostr-beyond/id1666230916" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plebstr.client" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Android</a> lets you sign into Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads, among other services, allowing you to scroll through posts and notifications from all those services in one place. When you install the application, you're asked to sign into your accounts for every service you want to use. From there, you can scroll through a combined timeline. A badge will let you know which network a given post is coming from and you can like, boost, and reply to posts just like you would if you were in the native app.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There are some obvious potential complications here. For one thing: if you follow the same person on three networks, you might see duplicate posts, depending on whether the people you're following tend to cross-post. And you can't cross re-post&mdash;that is, there's no streamlined way to share a Threads post with your Bluesky followers. Still, it's nice to be able to browse everything at once.</p><p>And there's support for more than just the combined timeline: you can add a combined Trending timeline that pulls from all your social networks, browse your Bluesky Discover feed, or scroll through the local timeline of your Mastodon server. You can write posts and publish them on all the social networks you've added. You can also disable posting to a certain account if you'd rather be a lurker on that network.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This application isn't perfect. There's no desktop version, for one thing, even though I was able to install the iPad version on my Mac. And using it requires a lot of actively thinking about which network you're interacting with. Even so, if you're tired of switching between three different social apps, it's worth a try.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Belts are useful tools for weightlifting (and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-a-weightlifting-belt-1850401310" target="_blank"><u>I have recommendations on my favorites here</u></a>), but who should be using them? And when? And how? Read on to get all your belt-related questions answered, and to figure out whether you, personally, could benefit from wearing a belt when you lift weights.</p><h2 id="how-a-weightlifting-belt-works">How a weightlifting belt works</h2><p>The main purpose of a belt, when lifting weights, is to help you brace better. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-does-engage-your-core-even-mean-1847019971" target="_blank"><u>Bracing</u></a>, as I&rsquo;ve written before, is when you contract the muscles all around your torso. It feels like what you&rsquo;d do if you were lying on your bed and saw your cat or toddler running in to jump on your belly. You&rsquo;d tense your abs and hold your breath, trying to make your torso rigid instead of squishy.&nbsp;</p><p>When you&rsquo;re about to do a heavy squat or deadlift, you&rsquo;ll do something similar. Visually it may look like you&rsquo;re expanding your belly, pushing it outward in all directions.&nbsp;When you wear a belt, you&rsquo;ll find that bracing your torso results in you pushing your belly <em>against</em> your belt. The belt helps to make your torso even more rigid, like a stone pillar standing strong. Good bracing helps you lift more than if you didn&rsquo;t brace; bracing against a belt helps you lift even more than bracing without one.&nbsp;</p><p>To put this another way, when you tense those core muscles and hold your breath, you&rsquo;re creating <em>intra-abdominal pressure</em>. Think of how a pool raft can hold more weight if it&rsquo;s fully inflated than if it&rsquo;s got a slow leak. The belt helps you to keep a strong, solid amount of pressure in your torso.&nbsp;</p><p>This, in turn, helps you to lift more weight, whether you&rsquo;re stacking that weight on top of your torso (as in a squat or an overhead press) or leaning your torso over to move the weight like a crane (as in a deadlift). In short: <strong>the purpose of a belt is to help you lift more weight</strong>. If you&rsquo;d like to geek out about the science behind this increased performance, I&rsquo;ll refer you to Greg Nuckols' <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-belt-bible/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Belt Bible</u></a>, which details the results of several studies on belted versus beltless performance.&nbsp;</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<h2 id="belts-probably-do-not-prevent-injury">Belts (probably) do not prevent injury</h2><p>But a belt also protects me from injury, right? (I can read your mind. I <em>know</em> this is what you&rsquo;re thinking about.) Unfortunately we actually <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have evidence that a weightlifting belt will protect your back when you lift heavy.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the evidence we have on belts and injury risk comes from occupational studies. The CDC&rsquo;s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/94-127/default.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>explains here</u></a> why we shouldn&rsquo;t expect belts to prevent back injuries. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161475405000102" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>2005 review article</u></a> agrees that &ldquo;there is no conclusive evidence&rdquo; that belts prevent back pain.</p><p>But if you believed that belts prevent injury, you&rsquo;re not alone! A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12930176/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>2003 survey of health club members</u></a> found that 90% (!) of belt-wearers said they wore the belt to prevent injury.&nbsp;Basically, even though it makes sense that increasing intra-abdominal pressure should help to protect the spine, studies just don&rsquo;t tend to find that people using belts get fewer injuries than people who go without.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="why-you-may-want-to-wear-a-belt-besides-lifting-more-weight">Why you may want to wear a belt (besides lifting more weight)</h2><p>Even if they don&rsquo;t <em>actually </em>prevent injury, many lifters feel more secure or comfortable when lifting a belt. You&rsquo;ll commonly hear lifters say that:</p><ul><li><p>They like the feeling of something to brace against.</p></li><li><p>The belt provides feedback so they know when they&rsquo;re bracing well.</p></li><li><p>Putting a belt on is part of their routine when they lift heavy, so it counts as mental preparation (which can help performance).</p></li><li><p>Believing the belt prevents injury can increase confidence, even if it&rsquo;s not really true.</p></li></ul><p>Since most people can lift more with a belt than without, putting on a belt is a way of decreasing the difficulty of a lift. For example, if you can squat 200 pounds beltless and 220 pounds with a belt, a beltless 200-pound lift is a maximal effort. But a belted 200-pound lift is just 90% of what you&rsquo;re capable of. In that way, putting on a belt can mean you&rsquo;re doing a slightly easier lift, which you could argue helps to manage the stress on your body in a way that <em>might</em> reduce your risk of injury in the big picture.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to say it <em>does</em> reduce injury, since we don&rsquo;t have direct evidence of that. But an experienced lifter who uses a belt appropriately is probably being smart about their training in a way that may well keep them healthier and stronger in the long run.</p><h2 id="how-much-more-can-you-lift-with-a-belt-than-without-one">How much more can you lift with a belt than without one?</h2><p>As a rule of thumb, you can probably expect to lift about 10% more with a belt than you can without. (Some lifters say 5% to 15% is the expected range.) So that would bring a 200-pound lift up to 220 pounds, for example. Or to put it another way, if your best squat is 285 pounds, you can probably hit that three-plate milestone (315 pounds) just by putting a belt on and learning how to use it.&nbsp;</p><p>And, yes, you do have to learn how to use it. If you&rsquo;re good at bracing, you&rsquo;ll pick it up quickly. But coaches often recommend beginners learn to lift without a belt first, to make sure they have good habits and technique.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-know-when-its-time-to-buy-a-belt">How do I know when it's time to buy a belt?&nbsp;</h2><p>There&rsquo;s no hard-and-fast rule about how many pounds your lifts need to be (or how heavy relative to your body weight) before you start belt shopping. In my opinion, if you&rsquo;re squatting and deadlifting regularly, and you can already brace effectively, it&rsquo;s worth getting a belt and starting to train with it at least some of the time.</p><h2 id="which-lifts-benefit-from-a-belt">Which lifts benefit from a belt?&nbsp;</h2><p>Squats and deadlifts benefit the most from using a belt. For standing lifts, like overhead press, most people find that a belt helps there as well.&nbsp;Olympic weightlifters often use a belt for clean and jerks, but not usually for snatches.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less clear for bench press. Some lifters find that a belt helps; others go without. (Note that people who wear a belt for this purpose for bench press wear a normal belt, the same one they use for squats and deadlifts. Skinny &ldquo;<a href="https://zdcs.link/V0DbO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=bench%20belts&amp;short_url=V0DbO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>bench belts</u></a>&rdquo; are a completely different animal, used in equipped lifting to hold your shirt down, and have nothing to do with what we&rsquo;re talking about here.)&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not supporting a large weight on your body, you don&rsquo;t need a belt for that lift. People do <em>not</em> typically need a belt for pullups, curls, rows, or most dumbbell work. That said, you can always try a lift with and without your belt, and see if you feel stronger when you wear it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="should-i-always-use-a-belt-when-lifting-heavy-or-only-sometimes">Should I always use a belt when lifting heavy, or only sometimes?&nbsp;</h2><p>This is a matter of preference and coaching philosophy. I can&rsquo;t give a universal answer, but I will say that a typical way of wearing a belt is to wear it for your heaviest &ldquo;regular&rdquo; squats, deadlifts, and presses.&nbsp;</p><p>I say &ldquo;regular&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s pretty common for a program to have a belted squat as your main type of squat, and then squat accessories (like tempo or pause squats) done beltless. You can&rsquo;t move as much weight without a belt, so this is a clever way to reduce the load on your body while still asking your muscles to work hard.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also be advised to lift without a belt sometimes to strengthen your core. It&rsquo;s arguable whether that&rsquo;s true (your core is very active in bracing whether you wear a belt or not), but regardless of the reason, some coaches like to program beltless lifts. Beltless lifts can also build your confidence: if you can lift this weight now <em>without</em> a belt, that you could previously only lift <em>with</em> a belt, that&rsquo;s a clear sign that you&rsquo;re getting stronger. Definitely celebrate your beltless PRs.</p><p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the question of which lifts in a session should be done with and without a belt. If you want a rule of thumb, <strong>many lifters put on a belt when the lift is over 85% of their max</strong> (for example, lifts over 191 pounds if their max is 225). That said, plenty of lifters will put the belt on for any heavyish lift.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="is-it-ok-to-lift-heavy-without-a-belt">Is it OK to lift heavy without a belt?&nbsp;</h2><p>Yes, because the belt isn&rsquo;t protecting you from injury, remember? It is fine to lift heavy without a belt. Just remember that if you forgot to pack your belt in your gym bag, you won&rsquo;t be able to lift the same weights beltless that you do belted. So if you&rsquo;re used to lifting heavy <em>with</em> a belt, but you have to go without, remember to reduce the weight by about 10%.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t normally lift with a belt, it&rsquo;s fine to continue going beltless. Just be aware that you would be able to lift more&mdash;thus giving your muscles more work&mdash;if you did start using a belt.</p><h2 id="how-tight-should-a-weightlifting-belt-be">How tight should a weightlifting belt be?&nbsp;</h2><p>A weightlifting belt should fit tightly enough that, after the lift, you&rsquo;ll want to take it off. You don&rsquo;t wear a belt for your whole gym session; you tighten it, lift, then take it off or loosen it. (I like to leave mine buckled on the loosest hole between sets, just so that I don&rsquo;t set it down and then forget where I put it.)&nbsp;</p><p>When the belt is buckled, it should feel snug. You should be able to shove a few fingers under the belt, but it won&rsquo;t be comfortable to keep it on that tight for that long.&nbsp;</p><p>When you do your squat or deadlift, the belt should be in a place where it doesn&rsquo;t pinch against your skin. You may want to wear the belt higher on your torso for deadlifts than for squats; try different positions for each lift and see what works best for you.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s okay for the belt to cover your lower ribs, as long as it&rsquo;s not uncomfortable there. Most belts made for lifting are four inches wide. Some people, especially those with shorter torsos, may prefer a three-inch belt. Speaking generally, almost everybody likes a four-inch belt for squatting, but some people prefer three inches for deadlifts.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-kind-of-belt-do-i-need">What kind of belt do I need?&nbsp;</h2><p>You&rsquo;re in luck&mdash;I have a whole guide to buying your first lifting belt. Most people will want to go with a belt that is either three or four inches wide (and the same width all around), either velcro or leather. If it&rsquo;s leather, 10 millimeters is a good thickness for most people. And for a closure, if it&rsquo;s a leather belt, you&rsquo;ll probably want either a single-prong buckle or a lever. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-a-weightlifting-belt-1850401310" target="_blank"><u>Read my recommendations here</u></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>A starchy foundation ensures your sauce will always be smooth and creamy.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've ever attempted making cacio e pepe at home and ended up with pasta coated in gritty cheese bits instead of a luscious sauce, know that you are not alone. That&rsquo;s why I ran to the kitchen after reading that adding a smidge of corn starch (about &frac34; of a teaspoon per serving) ensures a creamy, emulsified sauce every time. I&rsquo;m happy to report that this tip is completely legit. And it requires barely any extra work!</p><p>Cacio e pepe, the much beloved, deceptively simple pasta dish featuring pecorino romano cheese and black pepper, is easy to make&mdash;on paper. Just stir grated cheese into some pasta and a bit of the starchy pasta water you used when boiling it, add some pepper, and behold your creamy, cheesy dinner. </p><p>But this simple procedure can produce mixed results&mdash;sometimes you&rsquo;ll have perfect sauce, and other times, you'll wind up with a tragic bowl of noodles and cheese clumps surfing in water. Heartbreaking. It turns out this inconsistency has <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/perfect-cacio-e-pepe-recipe/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>bothered a number of hungry food scientists</u></a> too, and they&rsquo;ve figured out that a bit of added cornstarch is the best foolproof hack to avoid it. So I decided to give it a whirl.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-science-tells-us-about-cacio-e-pepe">What science tells us about cacio e pepe</h2><p>The reason you can achieve a silky pasta sauce from nothing but aged cheese and pasta water is because of the starch that leaches into that very water. Unfortunately, this process is incredibly inconsistent, and will vary with your water to pasta ratio when boiling the noodles&mdash;and even then it's usually around 1% when 2% to 3% starch is needed to stabilize the sauce.&nbsp;</p><p>They suggest making a small amount of cornstarch slurry, cooking it into a gel, and building your sauce with this starchy foundation to ensure you always have a consistent amount to make the sauce work.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Before running the test, I feared the sauce might end up too cornstarch-heavy, like a white gravy instead of a cheese sauce, but I was actually rather pleased with the results. The small amount of gel blends right into the other ingredients and cornstarch carries no flavor of its own, so its presence is completely undetectable. The finished sauce is smooth and tastes fiercely of pecorino, as it should. Most importantly, no cheese curds developed.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The directions are a little vague in the Popular Science article above, and there&rsquo;s a step where they add the cheese and gelatinized starch to a blender.

      <title>Five Ways to Tell If a Couch or Sofa Will Be Comfortable Over the Long Haul</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHR5QV7AJYQQ8FXXMDEHHKXK</guid>

      <description>It’s difficult—but not impossible—to figure out if a sofa is going to be comfortable when you have just a few minutes in the store.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR5QV7AJYQQ8FXXMDEHHKXK/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buying furniture on your own can be stressful. Aside from <a href="https://lifehacker.com/mattresses-internet-access-and-other-prices-you-didnt-1850631517" target="_blank">the cost</a>&mdash;if you&rsquo;re furnishing an entire two-bedroom house, that might run you <a href="https://homeguide.com/costs/cost-to-furnish-a-house" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">close to $25,000</a> depending on your choices&mdash;there&rsquo;s the stress of choosing pieces that fit your aesthetic vibe, measuring to make sure they fit the rooms, and determining whether the stuff will last long enough to justify the investment.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s what might be the most important factor: Comfort. Testing a piece of furniture for a few minutes in the store really doesn&rsquo;t tell you if you&rsquo;re going to love sitting on it for years to come, and nothing&rsquo;s more irritating than a couch or dining room chair that makes you unhappy, because that unhappiness bleeds into everything you&rsquo;re doing while using that furniture. While there are ways to improve the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-fix-an-uncomfortable-couch" target="_blank">comfort level of a couch</a>, ideally you shouldn&rsquo;t have to hack a brand new piece. The key is to use your time in the store wisely&mdash;here are five ways to tell if that furniture is going to be comfortable over the long haul.</p><h2 id="heavy-items-are-usually-sturdier">Heavy items are usually sturdier</h2><p>Take advantage of being able to physically interact with a couch or chair by picking up the cushions and feeling their heft and weight. Generally speaking, the heavier and more substantial a cushion feels, the more comfortable it will be to sit on. Thicker, heavier cushions have more material to compress, and thus will distribute your weight more evenly, reducing the chance of pressure points that go from mildly annoying to excruciating surprisingly fast.</p><h2 id="pay-attention-to-the-firmness-of-the-cushions">Pay attention to the firmness of the cushions</h2><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-can-revive-saggy-old-couch-cushions-for-cheap-1849053477" target="_blank">Cushions</a> can be softer or firmer, and the best choice is pretty personal. Some folks like a firm, unyielding cushion while others like to sink into a cloud. If you suffer from lower back pain, a firmer seat might be beneficial, but if you&rsquo;re buying a couch intended for use during cozy movie nights you might want a softer cushion. The key is to know your needs and how you&rsquo;ll use the piece, then seek out a cushion with the right squish factor.</p><h2 id="check-the-springs">Check the springs</h2><p>If the furniture you&rsquo;re shopping for is upholstered and utilizes springs, research the type of springs used. The most comfortable choice will usually be <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a25589587/8-way-hand-tied-sofas/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">eight-way hand tied coil springs</a>, which are manually attached to the furniture frame and densely arranged for maximum support. Because they&rsquo;re labor-intensive, however, furniture made using these springs is usually the most expensive choice. If that&rsquo;s outside your price range, opt for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/sofa-buying-advice/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">sinuous no-sag springs</a> (actually the most common springs you&rsquo;ll find in furniture), which use less material but offer decent support for comfortable use.</p><h2 id="evaluate-the-seat-depth-and-height">Evaluate the seat depth and height</h2><p>A key aspect of comfort&mdash;and one that is difficult to appreciate in a few minutes of frenzied sitting in a store setting&mdash;is the height and depth of various components, especially when it comes to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/knowing-the-difference-between-a-couch-and-a-sofa-can-m-1847038924" target="_blank">couches and sofas</a>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Seat depth (the distance from the front edge to the back cushion). </strong>The two things to consider here are your body and the intended use of the piece. Most sofas and couches have a seat depth <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/sca/ideas-and-advice/guides/sofa-dimensions-how-to-choose-the-right-size-sofa-for-your-home-T5595" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">between 20 and 25 inches</a>, but deep-seat pieces can have seat depths as high as 35 inches. Generally speaking, the taller you are, the more seat depth you&rsquo;ll want.</p><p>An extra consideration here is whether you see yourself <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-sleep-comfortably-on-a-couch-1849684779" target="_blank">sleeping on the couch</a>. For a single person, standard seat depth is probably workable (though more depth will be better for sleeping&mdash;consider that a twin bed is about 38 inches across). If you&rsquo;re going to be napping on the couch as often as you sit on it, deeper seats will be more comfortable overall.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seat height (distance from floor to the top of the seat cushion).</strong> This is usually around 17 or 18 inches, but if the sofa or couch is very deep, a low seat height will make it more challenging to get up without feeling like you&rsquo;re climbing out of a soft hole. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re tall, you might want a few extra inches of seat height.</p></li><li><p><strong>Back height (distance from floor to top of back).</strong> Most couches and sofas will have a back that&rsquo;s 26 to 36 inches. Buying a sofa or couch because it&rsquo;s sleek and modern often means a lower back, but if comfort is your goal, you&rsquo;ll also need to consider how you like to sit. If you like to drape your arms over the back of the couch, choose a lower back height. If you want more back support, go higher&mdash;and the taller you are, the more inches you&rsquo;ll want.</p></li></ul><p>One thing you <em>can</em> do in the store is get comfortable test how much work it takes to get up. If it&rsquo;s an effort in the store, it&rsquo;s not going to get magically easier at home.</p><h2 id="test-out-the-fabric">Test out the fabric</h2><p>The one thing most people do when furniture shopping is touch the stuff, so it might be obvious that you should make sure that any fabric covering your furniture is pleasant to touch. But the key is to really spend some time with it, because you will be touching it a <em>lot</em> when you get it home. If the fabric gives you a &ldquo;goose pimple&rdquo; reaction when you touch it, or if it feels rough against your skin, or if you show any signs of an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20163504/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">allergic reaction</a>, ask yourself if you can live with that feeling every day for the foreseeable future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Pros and Cons of the Best TikTok Alternatives</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Right now, there are three obvious platforms to migrate to: Red Note, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. But do they compare?</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <em>love</em> TikTok. As a grown-ass adult, this is not something I am proud of, nor will I share the total number of hours I&rsquo;ve spent scrolling to fall asleep, pass the time or catch up on what <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@good.boy.ollie?lang=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Good Boy Ollie</u></a> is doing. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-ban-news" target="_blank">As <u>Sunday</u> gets nearer</a>, I am feeling increasingly bereft. Everyone I know on TikTok is talking about the same thing: Where are we going next?&nbsp;</p><p>While a lot of options have been bandied about, and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/pixelfed-the-ad-free-instagram-alternative-now-has-a-smartphone-app" target="_blank"><u>new apps</u></a> emerge almost daily, there are still few platforms that share the most common traits of TikTok. Here are a couple. </p><h2 id="red-note">Red Note</h2><p>If you love TikTok, opening <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-rednote-or-xiaohongshu" target="_blank"><u>Red Note</u></a> will cause you to immediately relax&mdash;it looks remarkably similar. Well, first you have to go through a daunting sign-up process where you agree to who-knows-what in Chinese, and fumble through finding anyone you know.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Red Note looks and feels a lot like the original recipe; if all you need for your fix is the ability to scroll through an endless feed of content, Red Note could legitimately fill your cup. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;For You&rdquo; tab, and you can like, follow and favorite, like you had previously.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s even an alternative to TikTok Shop.&nbsp;</p><p>You will meet fascinating new people (many Red Note users seem eager to welcome Americans) and bonus: You might learn some Chinese. Creating posts is also quite similar to TikTok, where you can choose video or photo, add music, captions (subtitles), filters and have access to the same editing tools.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-2.fill.size_681x750.v1737011847.jpg" alt="Booktok on Red note" width="681" height="750" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-2.fill.size_800x881.v1737011847.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-2.fill.size_1400x1543.v1737011847.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-2.fill.size_2000x2204.v1737011847.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Traditional hashtags aren't clickable, but if you can find the Chinese equivalent, it will work.</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>There are no hashtags&mdash;when you see them in posts, they won&rsquo;t work. There do seem to be  <em>Chinese </em>hashtags, if you can figure out the Chinese equivalents. Otherwise, if that&rsquo;s how you found content or &ldquo;your people&rdquo; on TikTok, you're out of luck, at least for now. &nbsp;</p><p>Red Note doesn&rsquo;t know you yet, so moving from TikTok&mdash;where serious users enjoy a highly curated feed&mdash;to Red Note is going to feel dissociative for a little bit, as it learns your likes. While you might find previous TikTok users on Red Note by searching for their usernames individually, remember, not everyone is affected by the ban&mdash;only Americans. Because international users have had no need to move from TikTok, you probably won&rsquo;t find them.&nbsp;</p><p>In the last week on Red Note, many users of content no one would consider controversial have been banned, after only a day or their first post. In particular, it seems a lot of content creators making queer content are being banned (and when signing up, your only options for gender are binary). Remember, Red Note comes with a lot of political baggage that TikTok doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>It's entirely possible, too, that Red Note could one day be subject to a similar legal action as TikTok; that said, it took years for the current suit to proceed through the courts.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-3.fill.size_336x750.v1737011847.jpg" alt="gender choices on Red Note" width="336" height="750" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-3.fill.size_800x1785.v1737011847.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-3.fill.size_1400x3124.v1737011847.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-3.fill.size_2000x4463.v1737011847.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>My gut is that Red Note will figure out fast how to localize the app so Americans see it in English; from the time I logged in yesterday to today, I'd swear that they&rsquo;ve added more TikTok-like functionality. While I was turned off initially, today I found myself wanting to invest a little time finding people I followed on TikTok and seeing what happens. I&rsquo;m also, however, deeply curious about what I agreed to when I signed up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="instagram-reels">Instagram Reels</h2><p>In many ways, Reels seems the obvious successor to TikTok, although it's different in how you interact with your audience. Reels are more like a longer Instagram Story than a TikTok.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You probably already know how to use Reels. It lacks some of the robust editing tools that TikTok has, but still has captions, filters, music and text. You can tag people and businesses, locations, and target specific audiences. Comments aren&rsquo;t limited to a few sentences. Obviously, Instagram has the advantage of being in English, and uses hashtags to help people navigate. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Instagram is Meta, and Meta is on the cusp of <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/meta-ditches-fact-checkers-in-favor-of-xs-community-notes-model" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">some big changes</a> regarding moderation. Part of the beauty of TikTok was the exceptional moderation tools, which kept everyone behaving generally well. Complaints about the Instagram algorithm are endless and justified; you have very little control over what you see or who sees you, despite following accounts or asking not to see others. You&rsquo;ll see a lot of ads. And everything about Instagram is about selling, boosting or pushing, which is a real turnoff to many creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Reels doesn't seem to want to keep you in Reels&mdash;it routinely pushes you to regular Instagram. If you search by hashtag, you'll end up with a mix of posts and Reels (but not Stories).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-4.fill.size_336x750.v1737011847.jpg" alt="Booktok on Instagram" width="336" height="750" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-4.fill.size_800x1785.v1737011847.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-4.fill.size_1400x3124.v1737011847.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHPZCF4WBZBYGVCARF7K8V7A/images-4.fill.size_2000x4463.v1737011847.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide"></span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Lastly, you can&rsquo;t watch videos in 2x time on Reels, which feels downright insulting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re already using Instagram Reels, in addition to TikTok, because many content creators bifurcate their social media accounts, using them for different purposes, with different audiences. If that&rsquo;s the case, you might consider starting a new IG account to migrate your TikTok followers to. It certainly seems like most users are offering an Instagram account for followers, and many TikTokers have always kept an IG Reels account as a backup for their TikTok. You&rsquo;re likely to find a similar audience, if less well-behaved, on Instagram Reels.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="youtube-shorts">YouTube Shorts</h2><p>A lot of the big content creators are headed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>YouTube</u></a> and YouTube Shorts, and there&rsquo;s good reason: money. If you monetize TikTok, Youtube is the most stable, predictable channel there is for similar income, and many of those large creators started on YouTube in longer-form video. Shorts ends up feeling like a rudimentary TikTok, with less curation and less ability to organize. Since almost everyone knows what YouTube classic offers (ads, sponsor lead-ins and uncurated comments), let&rsquo;s talk about Shorts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> YouTube isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, ever. People know the platform, and they know what to expect from YouTube. You probably already have the app installed on your phone. Like Reels, the feed is mostly full of regurgitated TikToks, so it feels familiar. You can like a post (or dislike, which is a new and fun way to endure rejection), and subscribe to other users. You can also search by hashtag, and have the choice to watch Shorts or full-length videos.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Shorts are, at max, three minutes long, not longer as with TikTok and Reels. While there is a simple interface for making and uploading videos, it's overly simple. Unlike TikTok, you upload and process your Shorts video first and then edit it in the cloud, not locally on your phone to upload afterwards, which feels like a big commitment if you're not sure you're ready. There's no place to add captions, and while YouTube might add them via AI, they often contain errors. As with Instagram Reels, you have to watch Shorts at regular speed, even though you can speed up full-length videos.</p><p>There's a truly abhorrent lack of comment-moderation tools, or moderation, period. YouTube is (still) the Wild West, and for that reason, many find it unappealing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Shorts feels like a very different product than TikTok. Which is surprising, because classic Youtube generally incurs deeper and more loyal relationships between creators and watchers, where people are more tuned into specific creators than trends, hashtags or communities. Shorts, however, misses the mark on all of that. I suspect people who migrate back to YouTube will do so for long-form videos, not Shorts.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not so much that all American TikTok users are scattering to the wind. In the &ldquo;this is the last video I&rsquo;ll be making on TikTok&rdquo; videos I&rsquo;m consuming, users are posting links to all the platforms I named above, and one more: <a href="https://bsky.app/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Bluesky</u></a>. While Bluesky only allows you to post 60-second videos, it feels like a home base until the swarm figures out where to settle.&nbsp;</p><p>Realistically, for a while, I think you&rsquo;ll be seeing the same content across all three platforms while we wait it out and pray for TikTok to be brought back from the dead.&nbsp;All three of these tools have the same portrait-orientation video, with the ability to remix and share, and add music.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>You can still turn off noise cancellation on your AirPods.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you can't seem to figure out how to turn off noise cancellation on your AirPods Pro or AirPods 4 with ANC, you are not alone. After the iOS 18 update, many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1hfqn76/is_it_just_me_or_theres_no_option_for_turing_off/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">users across Reddit</a> noticed that the button to turn Noise Cancellation "Off" simply didn't show up for them anymore. Not in Control Center, and not in Settings.</p><p>As <a href="https://keydiscussions.com/2025/01/14/apple-opts-airpods-pro-2-and-airpods-4-owners-into-loud-sound-reduction-which-sounds-great-but-forces-users-into-transparency-or-noise-cancellation-modes-with-no-easy-way-to-opt-out/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">reported by Spencer Dailey</a> on his Key Discussions blog, users facing this issue could still see controls for the Active Noise Cancellation mode, the Transparency Mode, and the new Adaptive Audio mode that blends the two aforementioned modes to control noise levels based on your environment. But the "Off" button was missing, as I confirmed myself while taking the screenshot below. Those affected can't even turn noise canceling or transparency mode off by pressing and holding the stems of their AirPods (instead just switching between the two).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>That's a big problem. While transparency mode and noise cancelling are certainly useful, either for staying aware of or shutting out your environment, they also drain battery life. But not all is lost for those looking to eke every minute out of their earbuds. There is an easy way to bring back the Off button, and in typical Apple fashion, it's buried in the Settings app.</p><h2 id="how-to-bring-back-the-off-button-for-noise-cancellation-on-the-airpods-pro">How to bring back the Off button for Noise Cancellation on the AirPods Pro</h2><p>First connect your AirPods Pro or AirPods 4 with ANC to your iPhone. Then, tap on your AirPods from the top of the Settings app, scroll all the way down, and enable the "<strong>Off Listening Mode</strong>" feature. You'll now see a Loud Sound Reduction confirmation box. Here, Apple suggests that you use one of the Noise Cancellation modes to help reduce exposure to loud sounds. Simply tap the "<strong>OK</strong>" button.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-2.fill.size_2000x1124.v1737045988.png" alt="Disabled Off Listening Mode feature." width="2000" height="1124" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1737045988.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-2.fill.size_1400x787.v1737045988.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-2.fill.size_2000x1124.v1737045988.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Now, when you scroll up to the top of the AirPods settings page, you'll see four modes again, including an Off button. The Off button should also now be available in both the Press and Hold AirPods menu as well as Control Center.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-3.fill.size_2000x1500.v1737045988.png" alt="Off button added back to AirPods Noise Cancellation menu." width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-3.fill.size_800x600.v1737045988.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-3.fill.size_1400x1050.v1737045988.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-3.fill.size_2000x1500.v1737045988.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>But if you're using iOS 18.1 or beyond, that might not be the end of the story for you. Even with your new Off button, Apple might keep switching to Transparency as the default mode, instead of turning off Noise Cancellation, every time you put in your AirPods. This is because of the new hearing protection features that Apple introduced with the iOS 18.1 update.</p><p>Here, again, there is an obscure settings item to disable the Loud Noise Protection feature. After connecting your AirPods, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>AirPods and Beats</strong> and tap the <strong>Turn off Loud Sound Reduction</strong> option.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-4.fill.size_2000x1102.v1737045988.png" alt="Turn off Loud Sound Reduction in Settings." width="2000" height="1102" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-4.fill.size_800x441.v1737045988.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-4.fill.size_1400x771.v1737045988.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHR04N5NXH6MS6ZVR6MZ23DG/images-4.fill.size_2000x1102.v1737045988.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide"></span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Now, when you set your AirPods Noise Cancellation mode to "Off", it will stay "Off" no matter what. Although, the tradeoff is that your AirPods won't automatically block out loud sounds anymore. Still, <a href="https://www.apple.com/by/airpods-pro/specs/#:~:text=AirPods%20Pro%20*%20Up%20to%204.5%20hours,of%20talk%20time%20with%20a%20single%20charge5" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">According to Apple</a>, the AirPods Pro last 4.5 hours with Noise Cancellation enabled, but they can last 5 hours if you don't use Noise Cancellation or Transparency features. That tradeoff might just be worth it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Venus 3S offers Android and Apple users a long battery life of up to 10 days (depending on your use and settings), 8GB of storage, a built-in GPS to track your activity, and a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen. This 41mm size is perfect for people with smaller-sized wrists.  </p><p>The Venus 3S is user-friendly, with three buttons and a touchscreen to navigate its features and avoid accidentally stopping your workout. The smartwatch has a speaker and microphone so you can take your calls directly from your watch. You can also use it to listen to its guided meditation feature or your playlists from Spotify and Amazon music, just keep in mind there is no LTE support, so you'll need to be within Bluetooth or wifi range of your phone to use these features. </p><p>If you're looking for a smartwatch to do trail runs, this smartwatch is not it, since there's no trail-run feature. However, you can get stats on your recovery time after workouts as well as the benefits of your training, a morning report of your health status, heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, on-screen workouts you can follow along, their Body Battery Energy Monitoring that shows you how much or little energy you might have, as well as a Sleep Coach feature that helps you improve your sleep.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Remove Salty Streaks From Your Floor Without Damaging Them</title>

      <description>Winter means snow, and snow means salt, and salt means a mess.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Cold weather means more salt on the roads and sidewalks&mdash;but also on your floors as it gets tracked in on your shoes and boots and leaves salty streaks behind. Salt is great for dealing with ice outside but it is terrible for your flooring. Even if you&rsquo;re on top of making people remove their shoes when they enter your home, salty dust can still find a way onto your hardwood and other floor surfaces and could lead to permanent damage if you don&rsquo;t deal with it quickly and correctly. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do to get rid of it the right way.</p><h2 id="remove-salt-with-something-acidic">Remove salt with something acidic</h2><p>Salt deposits don&rsquo;t emulsify with soap and water, so don&rsquo;t waste your time with your usual mopping routine.  What you really need is a weak acid of some kind. Here&rsquo;s where <a href="https://lifehacker.com/8-things-you-probably-didnt-know-you-can-clean-with-vin-1846357379" target="">our old friend vinegar</a> comes in.</p><p>First, you need to get rid of any salt crystals by vacuuming or sweeping them up. You also need to wipe up any melted snow or moisture, so grab an old towel and do a quick dab. Be careful, though: Don&rsquo;t push it around, as any big crystals inside could scratch the floor (and you could push the water into the cracks in the floorboards, which could result in damage underneath). <em>Dab</em> that moisture with a cloth. </p><p>Next, mix vinegar and warm water at a ratio of a half a cup of vinegar per gallon of water. (If the salty streaks and stains are really bad, you can double the amount of vinegar.) This is what you&rsquo;ll use to clean once the solids and liquids are removed and all that's left are those streaks.</p><h2 id="how-to-apply-the-salt-cleaning-mixture">How to apply the salt cleaning mixture</h2><p>Spread your vinegar-and-water mixture in the same way you would when washing the floor as you usually would, which will differ depending on what it&rsquo;s made of. If it&rsquo;s tile or vinyl, for instance, you should coat it with a mop and leave it there a few minutes to dissolve the salt. If you&rsquo;re dealing with wood, use a spray bottle to mist the streaks, then dab up the moisture with a towel after a few minutes.</p><p>To prevent the streaks from coming back, keep a spray bottle of the mixture handy so you can tackle them as they&nbsp;pop up. Be vigilant about melting snow, too. Check under your door mat for any leaks, wipe up wetness as soon as it happens, and spray the area with your bottle for good measure.</p><p>The smell of vinegar usually dissipates after a while, but if you really hate it, you can go back through the room with your usual floor-cleaning supplies again after it&rsquo;s dried. </p><h2 id="the-best-salt-busting-cleaning-tools">The best salt-busting cleaning tools</h2><p>When you're spreading that solution around, you need something soft. This isn't the time to scrape, push, or otherwise get too abrasive. Microfiber is the answer. You can use <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXbP7?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=microfiber%20cloths&amp;short_url=avXbP7&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">microfiber cloths</a>, which are inexpensive and delicate, but I also understand if you don't want to be kneeling on salty, crusty, dirty floors to gently wipe with a rag. In that case, I recommend a dedicated microfiber mop. You'll want a mop designated for winter entryway and floor cleaning because you don't want to drag salt all around the house when you're cleaning non-salty areas. Instead of spending a bunch of money on a new microfiber mop that you'll only use a few months out of the year, I have a better idea: Pick up <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPpg3Z?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=this%20pack%20of%20two%20microfiber%20mop%20pads&amp;short_url=QPpg3Z&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">this pack of two microfiber mop pads</a> that are designed to fit around the head of a standard Swiffer Sweeper. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>For about $10, you get two stretchy covers so one can be used for dabbing up wetness and another can be used for applying your diluted vinegar. They're easy to remove from the Swiffer, so you can pop them in the laundry with ease so you can use a fresh pad every time you need one. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Here's When You Can Try the Switch 2 for Yourself</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHQRJQJ1GE9GEADBGZ9HK0Y7</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Hands-on demos are coming to cities around the world this April.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQRJQJ1GE9GEADBGZ9HK0Y7/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/nintendo-just-surprised-announced-the-switch-2" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is now officially revealed, and ... we don't really know much about it yet. It's a little bigger, it's backwards compatible, and the joy-con controllers are magnetic, but aside from those scant few details, there's not much to get excited for yet, apart from a more detailed Switch 2 Direct set for April. Maybe that's why Nintendo is giving folks the opportunity to try the new Switch for themselves around the same time.</p><p>Announced on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">company's website</a> alongside the new console, the "Nintendo Switch 2 Experience" will give attendees the opportunity to go hands-on with Nintendo's upcoming console before release, which is set for some time this year.</p><p>The demos will kick off on April 4th in New York and Paris and slowly tour around the globe, with Seoul currently being last on the list with an event set for May 31 - June 1. A few cities, like Hong Kong and Taipei, also have yet to have their Switch 2 Experience dates announced.</p><p>Given that the whole point of the Switch 2 Experience is to try out the console before it releases, I suppose that this also hints that we can expect the official release date for the console to be set for sometime after June.</p><p>The Switch 2 demos will be ticketed, so you'll need to register to attend, and registration will unfortunately work a bit like a lottery. Registration kicks off tomorrow, Jan. 17, at 3 PM ET and runs through Jan. 26 at 11 PM local time. Once you're registered, you'll be entered into a chance to get a ticket; on the plus side, registrations and tickets are free and registering early does not make you any more eligible.</p><p>You can also register in up to groups of six, although each attendee above the age of six will need their own (free) Nintendo Account, presumably to cut down on people filing multiple registrations per person.</p><p>For anyone outside the U.S. looking to travel to New York for the earliest possible look at the device, I also have some bad news&mdash;the demos in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas are open to U.S. residents only. Paris appears to be available to anyone, however.</p><p>Registrations will open up on Nintendo's website tomorrow. Check the below to see the full schedule.</p><ul><li><p>New York, April 4-6</p></li><li><p>Paris, April 4-6</p></li><li><p>Los Angeles, April 11-13</p></li><li><p>London, April 11-13</p></li><li><p>Dallas, April 25-27</p></li><li><p>Toronto, April 25-27</p></li><li><p>Tokyo, April 26-27</p></li><li><p>Milan, April 25-27</p></li><li><p>Berlin, April 25-27</p></li><li><p>Madrid, May 9-11</p></li><li><p>Amsterdam, May 9-11</p></li><li><p>Melbourne, May 10-11</p></li><li><p>Seoul, May 31-June 1</p></li><li><p>Hong Kong, TBA</p></li><li><p>Taipei, TBA</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

OpenAI also plans to release this feature to everyone with a free ChatGPT account, when the stable release rolls out.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-using-chatgpt-tasks">What can you do using ChatGPT Tasks?</h2><p>ChatGPT Tasks can be used to set simple reminders, like you'd ask Google Assistant or Siri, and the ChatGPT app will send you a notification with the reminder in question.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>But what's more interesting are the recurring tasks. You can do some prompt engineering and ask ChatGPT to do tasks for you at a particular time every day, or once a week, and it will perform those actions for you. And because it can trigger any prompt at a given time, you can ask it to do things like summarize the day's news (pulling from the open web using ChatGPT Search), create a new 10-minute workout each day, or give you a motivational quote every morning.</p><h2 id="how-to-create-recurring-tasks-in-chatgpt">How to create recurring tasks in ChatGPT</h2><p>You can create a new task from any conversation, but it might be better to create a new conversation for this.

      <title>What the Leaks Got Right About the Switch 2</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHQMJ6K0BXTFPHJQXYDHDHC1</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Pretty much everything, at least so far.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQMJ6K0BXTFPHJQXYDHDHC1/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early this morning, Nintendo finally revealed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in a surprise video announcement. That itself wasn't necessarily that much of a surprise: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-date-rumors-leaks" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Recent rumors</a> had suggested the company would do as much, and sooner rather than later. But in a slightly unexpected move, Nintendo dropped the video on YouTube without much fanfare or hype. Aside from a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1879879950854926422" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">complimentary post on X</a>, the company basically said, <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/a4a47a77-ed27-4d01-9187-aabc0ed06816" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">"Well, here you go."</a></p><p>Perhaps it's due to the fact <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-roundup" target="_blank">the Switch 2 itself has been leaked to death</a> that the company is taking less pleasure in the announcement. After all, accessory maker Genki <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-mockups-and-photos-leaks" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">essentially showed the tech world the Switch 2's design</a> at CES last week (though Nintendo says Genki's products were based on unofficial hardware, so it's possible Nintendo felt a drawn-out reveal wasn't necessary. Regardless, it you're really interested in the Switch 2, chances are you knew a lot about it already. Now, you've seen it for real.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-switch-2">This is the Switch 2</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-itpcsQQvgAQ"></div>
</div>


<p>In the video announcement, Nintendo gives us a direct comparison between the original Switch (not the Switch OLED) and the new console. You can see how much larger the Switch 2's display and hardware is, as well as some subtle tweaks in I/O. The kickstand design is much different, and much more flexible, as you can bend the console back to a steeper degree. </p><p>But the biggest changes, at least aesthetically, seem to be to the Joy-Cons. Nintendo opted to make them larger, slightly change their shape, and bump up the size of the shoulder buttons. The company has also flipped the color scheme: Colorful Joy-Cons on the OG Switch had black accents on the rails, but the new Joy-Cons are almost entirely black, with the colors added as accents to the rails and under the joysticks. As expected, the Joy-Cons connect to the new Switch magnetically, instead of aligning the rails with the console and clicking into place.</p><p>The reveal doesn't offer a super close look at the dock, but it does appear similar to the Switch OLED's, but in black&mdash;save, of course, for the large "2" next to the Switch logo. The same goes for the Joy-Con grip: It looks like a larger, more refined version of the OG Switch's grip, though Nintendo did display how you can "pop" the Joy-Con out to the side, showing off its magnetic connection. </p><h2 id="did-we-get-any-news-of-switch-2-exclusive-games">Did we get any news of Switch 2 exclusive games?</h2><p>Yes! Although we don't know many details yet. In the trailer, we appear to get a glimpse of a new <em>Mario Kart</em>, as the character designs are definitely not the same as those in <em>Mario Kart 8: Deluxe</em>.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Aside from that, there's no word on actual titles, available at launch or otherwise. However, Nintendo said Switch 2 will play both exclusive <em>and</em> original Switch games, and both physical and digital copies, so your existing cartridges should work with the new console. That said, some Switch games may not be supported by or fully compatible with Switch 2. Nintendo doesn't elaborate further, but this might be a situation where it makes sense to hold onto your original Switch, instead of trading it in for the new console. </p><h2 id="did-the-switch-2-reveal-include-anything-else">Did the Switch 2 reveal include anything else?</h2><p>Not really! Nintendo being Nintendo, this is just a sneak peak more or less confirming the massive amount of leaks and rumors we've already sifted through. Nintendo has longed promised a Switch 2 reveal in Q1 2025, and we got that. Now we wait for more information. </p><p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html?utm_source=HW&amp;utm_medium=soytnoa&amp;utm_campaign=S1001-01&amp;utm_id=S1001-01&amp;utm_content=announcement" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Nintendo points customers to a page on its website for more details</a> about Switch 2, but as of this article, it's just hosting a link to the reveal video. Perhaps they'll update the site with more information over time. For now, this is the Switch 2. It may not be surprising, but after so much time and so many leaks, it's hard to believe it's finally official. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>‘Explode’ Lets You Send Disappearing iMessages</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>If you've always wanted iMessage to be a little more like Snapchat, this is the app for you.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest messaging app rising up the iPhone App Store charts is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/explode/id6596779134" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Explode</a>. Explode helps you send disappearing (or "exploding") photos to your contacts on iMessage, designed to vanish after a few seconds. Like BeReal and Snapchat, the emphasis is on quick, one-to-one sharing that you don't have to think about too much.</p><p>There's another important feature here, too&mdash;your friends don't need to have the app installed to see what you're sending to them. They do, however, need to be on iMessage&mdash;this isn't something that's going to work on Android (you can't even jump to the web to view the message).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737028996.jpg" alt="Explode app" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1737028996.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1737028996.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737028996.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Take your photo, set a timer, choose a contact.</span>
                                        <span class="text-xs inline-block text-gray-600">Credit: Lifehacker</span>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>You'll need to provide your phone number and name to get started, and you can then add Explode to iMessage. All you need to do then is snap a picture (or pick one from your gallery), choose the time it'll be on screen for (between one and 10 seconds), and dispatch it. You can add some text on top of the image, or overlay some scribbles, and there's an the option to send a text-only image with a blank background.</p><p>The recipient gets to tap on the image to open it, then once the allotted time has run out, the picture shatters into pieces and is gone forever&mdash;it's quite a cool effect. There is, of course, a premium subscription available: Pay $7.99 a month or $39.99 a year, and you get extra features like screenshot blocking and photo replays.</p><p>There's very little in the way of settings and options here; Explode is designed to be as straightforward as possible. There is a history page where you can view pixelated versions of the images you've sent, and check up on who's viewed them, but that's it outside of the main photo-taking capabilities.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737028996.jpg" alt="Explode app" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1737028996.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1737028996.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHQFY38Y4TJP12B14R15B6SV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1737028996.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Explode will show live activity, if you let it.</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Be warned, though, that the app is quite aggressive when it comes to using Live Activities on the iPhone: It will <a href="https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1879236329558667608" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">display a persistent activity</a> on screen offering a month's premium subscription if you send three photos within an hour of first installing the app. You can disable Live Activities access for Explode (or any app) via the Apps menu in Settings, but it still feels a little intrusive as default behavior.</p><p>Explode is the work of <a href="https://x.com/nikitabier" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Nikita Bier</a>, who is previously responsible for the apps Gas and TBH&mdash;both of which let you send compliments and ask questions anonymously, before they were shut down after being acquired (by Discord and Meta respectively). </p><p>Disappearing photos are nothing new: It's what Snapchat is built on, and it's something you can do in apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and Instagram. However, the simplicity of Explode has a certain appeal, because there's nothing else to the app at all&mdash;and no need to nag your friends to download the app as well. But then, if it continues to be successful, I wouldn't be surprised to see a host of extra features start to be bolted on.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

Its rugged design, including a sporty lanyard and a cloth grille exterior, feels durable and ready for adventure. Additionally, its IP67 rating means it&rsquo;s waterproof and dust-proof, so whether it&rsquo;s by the pool or in the shower, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about water damage. For controls, you&rsquo;ve got the basics: buttons for play/pause, volume, power, and Bluetooth pairing. Double-tapping the play button skips forward a track, though you&rsquo;ll miss having a backtrack option. There&rsquo;s also no speakerphone functionality&mdash;a letdown, but forgivable at this price.</p><p>As for sound, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXmdO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Go%203&amp;short_url=QxXmdO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Go 3</a> is surprisingly well-rounded. It won&rsquo;t shake the room with bass, but its mono 1.5-inch driver delivers clear mids and highs and avoids distortion even at high volumes, according to this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/jbl-go-3" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag review</a>. Battery life is decent at around five hours, but your mileage may vary depending on volume levels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bluesky Is Getting Its Own Instagram (Sort Of)</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>If you've already invested in Bluesky, you're going to like Flashes.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNSYGQ3G59HPA9ARGW99E97/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/bluesky-is-the-new-twitter" target="_blank">one of the millions who joined Bluesky</a> in recent months, it's likely you're turned off by establishment social media platforms. You probably don't care for sites with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-faces-potential-134-billion-fine-from-eu" target="_blank">predatory data privacy policies</a>, or those that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-ditches-fact-checking-for-community-notes" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">placate to incoming presidential administrations with a disdain for the truth</a>. Maybe you enjoy an online space where people can share thoughts, content, and jokes in a way that doesn't explicit seek to anger or hurt anyone for profit.</p><p>Of course, Bluesky has you covered there, at least as a replacement for X. But if you enjoy sharing photos and videos with the wider internet, you're likely still tied to Instagram&mdash;like it or not. There are other options out there, like Pixelfed, a decentralized photo sharing platform <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/pixelfed-the-ad-free-instagram-alternative-now-has-a-smartphone-app" target="_blank">that now has an official app</a>. But if you're all-in on Bluesky, it'd be great if you could harness the same experience with the community you've started to build there.</p><p>That's why Flashes is one of the more interesting social media concepts I've seen recently. The app, developed by Sebastian Vogelsang, is based off of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-skeets-app-to-edit-bluesky-posts" target="_blank">his earlier app Skeets</a>, a subscription-optional Bluesky client with a emphasis on accessibility, among other features (if you want to be able to edit your posts, for example, Skeets uses a nifty workaround to do it). But for Flashses, Vogelsang's focus was to make an Instagram-like experience for photos and videos shared on Bluesky. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That's the thing: Flashes isn't really an Instagram competitor. There is no Flashes platform, you won't sign up for a Flashes account, and you won't post photos or videos to a dedicated Flashes feed. Instead, the app is a "photo viewing client" for Bluesky. It essentially pulls all of the photos and videos from your Bluesky feed and displays them in a UI reminiscent of Instagram. You can post photos and videos via Flashes, but you're really just posting them on Bluesky. Any posts to Flashes, as well as any comments on those posts, will appear on your Bluesky account as well. </p><p>If you're intrigued, unfortunately you'll have to wait a bit before you can try it: The <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:24kqkpfy6z7avtgu3qg57vvl" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">official Flashes App Bluesky account</a> only started posting today, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flashesapp.bsky.social/post/3lfshio2jb22o" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Vogelsang anticipates</a> starting an open Testflight Beta next week for iOS users. But once the app officially launches, you'll be able to use it post four photos or videos at a time. (Videos can be up to one minute each.) </p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/bluesky-is-getting-its-own-photo-sharing-app-flashes/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">According to TechCrunch</a>, Vogelsand also plans to launch a video-only version of Flashes, called Blue Screen. Perhaps that will be a valid TikTok alternative for truly passionate Bluesky users.</p><div class="raw-embed">

</div>
<p>The news of Flashes comes at an uncertain time for legacy social media. Users have flown from X to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/bluesky-is-the-new-twitter" target="_blank">alternatives like Bluesky</a>; the United States government is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet" target="_blank">on the verge of banning TikTok</a>, prompting users to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-rednote-or-xiaohongshu" target="_blank">flee to other Chinese apps in protest</a>; and Meta is repelling many of its users with its bizarre and frustrating decisions. We seem to be at an inflection point, and people are looking for new, alternative platforms. If you've already built-up your Bluesky follows, I don't see a better photo sharing solution than one that simply works with the app you're already so invested in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Make sure you're covered when disaster strikes.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Los Angeles County continues to battle <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/fire-los-angeles-california-palisades-ventura-eaton-01-15-25-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>devastating wildfires</u></a>, you may be wondering about the safety of your own home. More specifically, how are you covered when the unthinkable happens?</p><p>Unfortunately, insurance doesn't function like a gas or electric company; even in the face of disaster, insurers <a href="https://lifehacker.com/if-your-home-insurance-lapses-do-these-things-immediat-1850642820" target="_blank"><u>aren't obligated</u></a> to service your home. And while homeowners insurance isn't legally mandated, choosing to forgo protection in an attempt to save money could prove to be <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/why-homeowners-insurance-is-important" target="_blank">one of the most expensive decisions</a> a homeowner can make.</p><p>Homeowners insurance is a crucial financial protection for your home and belongings, but many homeowners don't fully understand their coverage. Let's take a look at how exactly homeowners insurance works so that you can make informed decisions about your coverage.</p><h2 id="what-homeowners-insurance-covers">What homeowners insurance covers</h2><p>The main categories of homeowners insurance are structure protections, personal property, liability protection, and additional living expenses.</p><h3>Structure protection</h3><p>Your policy's dwelling coverage protects the physical structure of your home from covered perils. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Fire and smoke damage</p></li><li><p>Wind and hail damage</p></li><li><p>Lightning strikes</p></li><li><p>Falling objects</p></li><li><p>Vandalism</p></li><li><p>Theft</p></li><li><p>Vehicle damage to your home</p></li></ul><p>When it comes to costs, the coverage should be enough to rebuild your home entirely at current construction costs, not the market value or purchase price. </p><h3>Personal property</h3><p>This coverage protects your belongings inside the home, typically including:</p><ul><li><p>Furniture</p></li><li><p>Electronics</p></li><li><p>Clothing</p></li><li><p>Appliances</p></li><li><p>Other personal items</p></li></ul><p>Most policies cover personal property at 50 to 70% of your dwelling coverage. High-value items like jewelry, art, or collectibles often need additional coverage through riders or endorsements.</p><h3>Liability protection</h3><p>This crucial coverage protects you if someone is injured on your property or if you accidentally damage someone else's property. It typically covers:</p><ul><li><p>Medical expenses for injured guests</p></li><li><p>Legal defense costs</p></li><li><p>Court judgments</p></li><li><p>Property damage you cause to others</p></li></ul><p>Most experts <a href="https://www.insurance.com/home-insurance/personal-liability-coverage/how-much-personal-liability-coverage-do-i-need#:~:text=A%20standard%20home%20insurance%20policy,recommend%20%24300%2C000%20%2D%20500%2C000%20of%20protection." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">recommend</a> at least $300,000 in liability coverage, though many suggest $500,000 or more.</p><h3>Additional living expenses (ALE)</h3><p>If your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss, ALE coverage pays for:</p><ul><li><p>Temporary housing</p></li><li><p>Additional food costs</p></li><li><p>Pet boarding</p></li><li><p>Other necessary expenses</p></li></ul><h2 id="whats-not-covered-by-homeowners-insurance">What's not covered by homeowners insurance</h2><p>Unfortunately, homeowners insurance is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-parties" target="_blank">not all-encompassing</a>. There are standard exclusions to consider. Most policies don't cover:</p><ul><li><p>Flood damage (requires separate flood insurance)</p></li><li><p>Earthquake damage (requires separate coverage)</p></li><li><p>Normal wear and tear</p></li><li><p>Pest infestations</p></li><li><p>Mold (unless resulting from a covered water damage event)</p></li><li><p>Sewer backup (unless you add specific coverage)</p></li><li><p>Business-related liability</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-much-coverage-you-need">How much coverage you need</h2><p>Understand that how much your home is worth is a different number than what your insurance covers. Your home's market value includes land value and location premium, while insurance should cover <em>rebuilding</em> costs only. To get an idea of how much coverage you need, use these factors.</p><h3>Dwelling coverage</h3><p>Calculate needed coverage based on:</p><ul><li><p>Local construction costs per square foot</p></li><li><p>Your home's size and features</p></li><li><p>Special materials or craftsmanship</p></li><li><p>Local building code requirements</p></li></ul><p>Add 10-20% buffer for unexpected costs or construction price increases.</p><h3>Contents coverage</h3><p>To determine adequate coverage:</p><ol><li><p>Create a home inventory with photos and receipts</p></li><li><p>Consider replacement cost vs. actual cash value coverage</p></li><li><p>Identify high-value items needing separate coverage</p></li><li><p>Account for seasonal items and stored belongings</p></li></ol><h2 id="money-saving-tips">Money-saving tips</h2><p>Like I mentioned at the top, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/why-homeowners-insurance-is-important" target="_blank">skipping insurance to save money won't be worth it</a>. Any short-term savings can quickly transform into devastating financial losses when disaster strikes. Instead of eliminating coverage, consider these money-saving strategies:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Increase your deductible</strong>: Raising your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can lower premiums by 15 to 20% or more, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/30/how-to-mitigate-rising-auto-and-homeowners-insurance-costs.html#:~:text=With%20car%20insurance%2C%20for%20example,at%20the%20Insurance%20Information%20Institute." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>according to CNBC</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bundle policies</strong>: Combining home and auto insurance <a href="https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-bundle-home-and-auto-insurance#:~:text=Amica%20advertises%20discounts%20of%20up,home%20and%20auto%20insurance%20bundles." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>often yields discounts</u></a> of 15-25%.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improve home security</strong>: Installing security systems and smoke detectors can reduce premiums while protecting your home.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shop around annually</strong>: Insurance rates vary significantly between providers. Regular comparison shopping ensures you're getting the best value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask about discounts</strong> for things like a new roof, smart home devices, or having a claims-free history.</p></li></ol><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>Remember that homeowners insurance is not a maintenance policy, but protection against sudden and accidental losses. Update your policy after completing any major renovations, acquiring valuable items, or after life changes (marriage, children, etc). Regular maintenance and proactive risk management remain your responsibility as a homeowner.</p><p>Insurance policies vary widely. Always consult with a professional insurance agent to understand your specific coverage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Here's How to Prevent Your Watch Band From Irritating Your Skin</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHNVRDCQDMRFZ3NN7PXY0SZP</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Fitness trackers and smartwatches are worn 24/7—which can lead to skin irritation if you're not careful.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNVRDCQDMRFZ3NN7PXY0SZP/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Fitness trackers and smartwatches want to live on your wrist 24/7. You'll want them on during a workout, of course, and then for sleep tracking, and of course you wouldn't want to miss out on the stress readings and data displays throughout the day. But after a while of wearing a tight silicone band every minute of the day, you may find your skin starts to get red or itchy. Here are some tips on how to reduce the chances of irritation, and what you can do if you already have a rash.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="wear-your-watch-loosely-when-youre-not-working-out">Wear your watch loosely when you're not working out</h2><p>Most makers of smartwatches and fitness trackers say that you should wear them loosely for daily wear. <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14225145" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Fitbit</u></a>, for example, writes that you should wear the band &ldquo;loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist&rdquo; and instructs you to &ldquo;Lower the band on your wrist and loosen it after exercise.&rdquo;</p><p>This loose fit allows air to contact your skin as the watch moves around during the day. This way, no part of your skin gets moisture or sweat trapped against it.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/watch-fit-and-care/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Garmin</u></a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118234" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Apple</u></a> (to name a few) all say basically the same thing. During exercise, you&rsquo;ll want to wear the watch snugly, above your wrist bone (so it&rsquo;s at least an inch or two away from your actual wrist joint). This lets you get a nice, snug contact between the heart rate sensor and your skin. But once the workout is over, loosen the watch back to a more comfortable position.&nbsp;</p><p>A good rule of thumb is that when you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> working out, the watch should be able to move back and forth on your wrist. But during a workout, if you try to slide the watch, your skin should move with it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="rinse-the-watch-band-daily">Rinse the watch band daily</h2><p>Irritation can happen when sweat, moisture, or other substances (like, say, soap) get trapped against your skin. An easy way to avoid this is to take the watch off and rinse it when you&rsquo;re in the shower.&nbsp;</p><p>If not in the shower, then try to find some other time during the day&mdash;maybe while you&rsquo;re washing your hands&mdash;to take the watch off and makes sure it&rsquo;s clean. Check the care instructions that came with your device; you may be advised to <em>not</em> use soap.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="consider-a-different-material-for-the-band">Consider a different material for the band</h2><p>Waterproof materials like silicone tend to be the worst culprits for irritation, probably because of the way they can trap sweat and moisture against the skin. If this is an ongoing issue for you, consider a fabric watch band that breathes a little better.

<p>A pro tip, though: if you&rsquo;re going to get a fabric band, get two. That way you can still wash them (or wear them in the shower or pool) and then swap for a dry one rather than wearing the soggy one for the rest of the day.</p><h2 id="give-your-skin-a-break-if-its-already-irritated">Give your skin a break if it&rsquo;s already irritated</h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve already gotten a rash on your skin, the most important thing is to <em>stop wearing the watch</em> while you wait for it to heal. If you take a break from your watch at the first sign of irritation, it will probably clear up quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>The one time I had some redness and itching from a Garmin strap, I immediately washed the watch and then, once it was dry, put it back on my <em>other</em> wrist. Yes, it feels weird to have your watch on the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; wrist, but you need to give your skin a chance to heal. It&rsquo;s also OK to simply not wear the watch for a while.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>This Photo-Sharing App Feels Like a Return to Instagram’s Glory Days</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHNJ28JNX2ZYAJENSMWAZPBF</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Remember when Instagram was actually an app for sharing photos?</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNJ28JNX2ZYAJENSMWAZPBF/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you one of the many <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-keep-politics-out-of-your-instagram-feed" target="_blank">reconsidering their relationship with Meta's Instagram</a>? If you're looking for another outlet to share your photos, Pixelfed, an open source photo-sharing alternative without ads or tracking, has officially launched mobile apps for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelfed" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelfed/id1632519816" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">iPhone</a>. </p><p>These apps, which allow you to upload photos and videos directly from your phone, arrive just a few days after <a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Meta blocked users from sharing links to the service</a> (prompting a few days of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pixelfed/113813596301663822" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">unprecidented levels of traffic</a> in backlash).</p><p>Pixelfed, like Mastodon, is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-the-fediverse-the-potential-future-of-social-media" target="_blank">part of the Fediverse</a>, meaning people on Mastodon can follow accounts on Pixelfed, and vice-versa. It also means that signing up can be a little confusing to Fediverse neophytes: When getting set up, you will need to choose a server in order to share photos and follow other users. The biggest server, <a href="http://pixelfed.social" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">pixelfed.social</a>, is currently lagging due to a large influx of new users, so it's worth considering the other options presented in the app itself (or <a href="https://pixelfed.org/servers" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">browse this directory</a>).</p><h2 id="remember-when-instagram-was-fun">Remember when Instagram was fun?</h2><p>Decentralization is interesting and laudable, sure, but the thing I like best about Pixelfed is that it feels like a return to Instagram's glory days. As you might recall, Instagram used to be a photo sharing service. Yes, you technically can still share photos on Instagram, but it's been a long time since that was the primary focus of the application. Your timeline, once filled with photos from people you follow, is these days dominated by ads and "recommended" videos from celebrities and strangers. </p><p>Despite some <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-reset-your-instagram-algorithm" target="_blank">recent changes to give you back a little more control</a>, Insta is also ruled by the algorithm, which means that when you post a photo, there's less of a chance that your friends will actually see it. Because of this, the people you care about are probably posting fewer photos than they used to, which in turn frees up the algorithm to put more random videos in your timeline. It's enough to make you wonder why anyone still uses the service&mdash;it's certainly not for the reasons they signed up for it.</p><p>The Pixelfed mobile app, in contrast to Instagram's current incarnation, is simple. You can scroll through the photos posted by people you've chosen to follow. You can see the most popular photos on your server, or the entire Fediverse. Or you can upload photos. These new applications technically aren't the first Pixelfed apps&mdash;there were plenty of third party applications that could access it, and those still exist. But now there's also an official app, and it works pretty well.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Another thing that's missing from Pixelfed: ads and any kind of tracking. The developer team promises those "features" are never coming. In a Mastodon post, developer Daniel Supernault said "Pixelfed is a lot of things, but one thing it is not, is an opportunity for VC or others to ruin the vibe," adding that he turned down VC funding and plans to never add ads. "Pixelfed is for the people, period."</p><p>I'm not the kind of tech journalist who likes to make predictions about which applications will "win." I will say, though, that the internet would be a better place if that mentality were more common. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>‘The Mocktail Club’ Recipe Book Can Take Dry January to the Next Level</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHNP7AMVDJH3GP91B53JET8N</guid>

      <description>With this recipe book, you an make mocktails worthy of a celebration.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNP7AMVDJH3GP91B53JET8N/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p><em>Welcome to &ldquo;</em>Cookbook of the Week.<em>&rdquo; This is a series where I highlight cookbooks that are unique, easy to use, or just special to me. While finding a particular recipe online serves a quick purpose, flipping through a truly excellent cookbook has a magic all its own.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>It may be halfway through Dry January, but I think a mocktail book is still in order. Alongside the folks who desire a once-per-year cleanse are those that skip the booze year-round. In which case, this week&rsquo;s cookbook,<em> The Mocktail Club</em>, is right on time.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I enjoy an adult beverage from time to time, but there are many social occasions where I find myself looking at the cocktail menu like it&rsquo;s the last thing I want near me. But when the mocktail finally got a foothold in the industry and began to gain popularity, I gladly pulled up a stool.</p><h2 id="a-bit-about-the-book">A bit about the book</h2><p>There&rsquo;s always been a feeling, strong or lingering, that social drinking requires alcohol. While that&rsquo;s fine if it fits your lifestyle, it can simultaneously exclude others if there are no other options. Enter: The mocktail. For those of you that might be unfamiliar, a mocktail (besides being a clever play on the word &ldquo;cocktail&rdquo;) is a non-alcoholic drink that combines two or more components.</p><p><em>The Mocktail Club</em> comes to us from Derick Santiago, a certified mixologist who has poured his knowledge into non-alcoholic libations that are just as complex and delicious as the booze-infused. This petite hard cover was published in 2024, and has 75 non-alcoholic recipes in it, including alcohol-free spins on classics like the pi&ntilde;a colada, or B&amp;T (botanicals and tonic).</p><h2 id="a-great-book-for-those-who-wont-settle-for-juice">A great book for those who won't settle for juice</h2><p>The challenging thing about mocktails, especially in the early years, is that many of the smaller ingredients or components would include alcohol too&mdash;liqueurs, bitters, vermouth. Achieving the complexity of cocktails without these smaller additions led to one-dimensional drinks, or sometimes just fancy juices. In the past, being alcohol-free meant your options were rather limited, and not everyone wants six Diet Cokes or waters when they&rsquo;re at their wife&rsquo;s birthday party.</p><p>These days, the options have opened up. Now there are plenty of brands and businesses in the alcohol-free space, brewing up non-alcoholic tequilas, whiskeys, bitters, and more. <em>The Mocktail Club</em> uses the full range of what is available so now you don&rsquo;t have to settle for soda or juice if you don&rsquo;t want to. You can make beautiful, nuanced drinks that don&rsquo;t feel like a replacement or a disguise; they are actually sophisticated drinks you want to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a book for someone who wants to truly dive into the world of NA mocktails with gusto. It&rsquo;s not for someone who wants to make an easy mocktail out of regular ol&rsquo; ingredients from the refrigerator. You&rsquo;ll need supplies, non-alcoholic spirits, and to do a little pre-work with syrups and shrubs.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="the-recipes-you-can-expect">The recipes you can expect&nbsp;</h2><p>Part of the reason I chose to feature <em>The Mocktail Club</em> is because of how thorough the front matter is before the &ldquo;real&rdquo; recipes start. Santiago takes the time (but not too much space) to explain what a mocktail is, important terminology, how non-alcoholic versions of spirits are made, and what flavors they mimic.&nbsp;</p><p>Santiago gives you a full section of simple syrup recipes, shrub recipes, and accoutrements that add that &ldquo;little something&rdquo; to push the drink over the edge. You&rsquo;ll learn different types of shaking methods, including one that can help you replace alcoholic bitters with a simple orange peel.&nbsp;</p><p>The recipes are organized by the primary non-alcoholic spirit in the recipe, chapters like Gin-inspired Mocktails or Rum-inspired Mocktails, lead the way. Aperitifs and completely Spirit-free Mocktails close out the book.&nbsp;</p><p>Each recipe has a headnote that briefly explains the flavor profile of the drink and how the ingredients work together. Most of the measurements are for single servings, or occasionally two, so I can see batching these drinks for a party might be cumbersome with the math. But not impossible.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-drink-i-made-this-week">The drink I made this week</h2><p>I made the General Giuseppe mocktail this week. I&rsquo;ve been musing about a trip to Italy for next year and this bright orange drink seemed to match my mood. At first, I was irritated because I wanted to already have all the components it needed, but I did not. Then I realized that a good mocktail is going to require a little work on my part. The mocktail ingredients <em>have to</em> be different from what I have because my home bar is an alcohol zone.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, finding a &ldquo;non-alcoholic Italian red aperitif&rdquo; is not as hard as I thought. You can <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5XAZ?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=buy%20a%20pack%20online&amp;short_url=QL5XAZ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>buy a pack online</u></a> (this stuff is actually pretty tasty on its own), or check out any Italian specialty stores you have in the area. You might be surprised that some Italian restaurants will sell these items too. I bought my bottle from an Italian sandwich shop in my neighborhood. The same goes for non-alcoholic or zero-proof orange bitters. Check out stores that sell mixers, bougie liquor stores, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aewdr5?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=buy%20them%20online&amp;short_url=aewdr5&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>buy them online</u></a>.</p><p>The drink was only three ingredients, and easy to prepare; a dry shake before adding ice. The delicious, brightly hued beverage that I poured into my rock glass surpassed expectations. I was worried it would be too sweet, maybe too juicy, or just boring, but it was nothing like that. The sweetness of the orange juice was met head-on with the bitter aperitif. While the light addition of orange bitters added an aromatic depth to make it taste &ldquo;cocktail-y.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, I didn&rsquo;t have to pour it out for once. Whenever I make alcoholic cocktails for work, it&rsquo;s usually 11 a.m., and that is not for me.</p><h2 id="how-to-buy-it">How to buy it</h2><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YO6no?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=The%20Mocktail%20Club&amp;short_url=9YO6no&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em><u>The Mocktail Club</u></em></a> is available online, naturally, and in real life at a number of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGXOY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Barnes%20%26%20Noble%20bookstores&amp;short_url=QGGXOY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores</a>. Remember, you can support your local brick and mortar bookstores by asking them to order it to their location if they don&rsquo;t have it in stock. While I did not try batching any mocktails from the book, I think I will for the next get-together I attend. If you do it before I do, let me know how it goes, and enjoy your Dry Whichever-month.</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

      <title>Why I Use Mug Warmers With All My Candles</title>

      <description>This is one of my favorite ways to make my home smell great without an open flame.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNHST0SKGWZ5XKMVPYNBRFX/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Last year, I was searching high and low for a good present to get my mom, who loves gadgets but for whom I have already purchased every Alexa-enabled device, plus a whole slew of Apple products. I dug my own grave by maxing her out on electronics and doodads and was left with few gift options&mdash;that is, until I noticed a product advertised as a mug warmer. </p><p>I initially thought she could plug it into one of her many smart outlets and command her army of Amazon Echos to keep her drinks warm, so I bought it immediately. That was not, however, how she ended up using it&mdash;what sits atop this drink warmer is a candle. She found the smartest way to make her home smell amazing, then passed the knowledge on to me. Now, I'm passing it on to you because this is a <em>great </em>hack. </p><p>Candle warming is a super efficient way to make your entire home smell fantastic. My mom lives in a four-level house and says that when she sets a candle on her mug warmer, the smell permeates at least two levels away from wherever the device is. Simply lighting a candle doesn't yield the same result. </p><p>Unlike traditionally lighting a candle, the warmer causes the wax to melt from the bottom up. It does take a while for the smell to hit, but once it does, the scent is unstoppable. For a smaller candle, around 14 ounces, the process takes about an hour and the smell grows in intensity the whole time. </p><p>You can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbOY5?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=designated%20candle%20warmers&amp;short_url=aAbOY5&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">designated candle warmers</a> for about $30, but the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z5m8R?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=smaller%20heaters&amp;short_url=9Z5m8R&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">smaller heaters</a> designed for mugs can be as low as $9.99. The ones designed to heat candles, specifically, usually work by heating from the top down and are generally available in more decorative designs. I prefer the mug warmer primarily because it's cheaper, but also because it's more useful overall, even if it isn't as pretty on the shelf. First, as the candle heats from the bottom, the smell builds in intensity. If you <em>want </em>a less intense scent, you can stop the warmer, which gives you a little more control and customizability. Second, the candle warmers that heat from the top are designed specifically to do that, which is awesome, but you can't benefit from the dual-purpose glory the mug warmer offers. Remember, it's a <em>mug warmer</em>, so you can use it as one whenever you want. The fancier, more expensive, top-down warmers don't do much for your coffee, but the mug warmer can be used for its original purpose with ease. To me, it just makes more sense to get the cheaper device that does more around the house. </p><p>The one I've purchased for my mom and myself is no longer available on Amazon, but it was similar to this:</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<h2 id="what-to-keep-in-mind-when-heating-candles-on-a-mug-warmer">What to keep in mind when heating candles on a mug warmer</h2><p>First of all, the surface here is pretty small, so you're not going to be doing this with big, three-wick candles. That would take too long, anyway. </p><p>Second of all, once you do this to a candle, you won't be able to burn that one again. Once the whole thing liquifies, the wick can start, as my mom puts it, "floating around in there." When it hardens again after you turn the warmer off, there's no guarantee the wick will be sticking out and available for lighting in the future. Granted, once you try this fire-free option and see how much more intense the scent is, you may not want to bother lighting a candle again anyway. The best candle I've found for this is from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gORqD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Bath%20%26%20Body%20Works&amp;short_url=9gORqD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Bath &amp; Body Works</a> and I assume the powerful smell comes from the brand's tendency to put essential oils in its product. The exterior doesn't get sweaty, the labels don't peel off, and there are really no safety issues or other problems beside the fact that you'll probably lose access to your wick. (I should note, however, that you shouldn't try to move the candle until after the wax has cooled and re-solidified. The glass will be warm to the touch and moving it too soon means risking spilling hot wax all over the place, which is not ideal.) </p><p>I love this method because it is safer than traditional candle burning. I am a huge fan of candles and scents overall, but I don't really enjoy having open flames out and about in my home, so this takes away some anxiety while providing better service. Plugging the warmer into a smart outlet also means I can check an app to be <em>sure</em> it's not still on, even when I'm out, which is not possible with an open-flame candle. </p><p>My mom has requested, however, that I let you know that safety features can also be a slight negative if you don't prepare correctly: "One thing to remember when choosing a candle is that these mug warmers are meant to go off when you lift a coffee mug off of them, so you need to make sure that the candle has a good flat base and some weight to it to keep the warmer on," says she, the expert. </p><p>Finally, the wax doesn't really disappear the way it does with a normal candle. Rather, it loses potency. You can aim to heat yours 15 to 20 times, then, if it's losing scent power, consider swapping it out for a new one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Like most tech products, the Apple Watch comes in a basic model (the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7E3KL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=SE&amp;short_url=z7E3KL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>SE</u></a>), a mid-tier model (like the Series 9 or 10), and a high-end version (the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXmwK?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Ultra%202&amp;short_url=9wXmwK&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Ultra 2</u></a>). But the Series 9 offers arguably the best bang for your buck, with many premium features and a price that's closer to the SE than the Series 10 or Ultra 2. </p><p>The Series 9 is has fewer features for outdoor enthusiasts than the Ultra 2, but if you want to save yourself a few hundred dollars and don't need a brighter screen or a more rugged design, the Series 9 is a great choice. PCMag gave the Series 9 an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-watch-series-9" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>"outstanding" review</u></a> for its powerful processor, the in-demand double-tap gesture for hands-free operation, access to Siri, and its bright display.</p><p>The GPS version only allows you to access your phone if you're connected to the same wifi network or are close enough for a Bluetooth connection. In other words, you won't be able to go on a run without your iPhone and expect to play music on your AirPods or take calls unless you want to get a used <a href="https://zdcs.link/Gd16x?pageview_type=RSS&amp;amp%3Btemplate=Deals&amp;amp%3Bmodule=content-body&amp;amp%3Belement=offer&amp;amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp;amp%3Belement_label=GPS%20%2B%20Cellular%20version&amp;amp%3Bshort_url=Gd16x&amp;amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fapple-watch-series-9-deal&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=GPS%20%2B%20Cellular%20version&amp;short_url=Gd16x&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>GPS + Cellular version</u></a> for <strong>$263.09</strong>.</p><p>The aluminum case is cheaper than the stainless steel model, and the 45mm screen is for those who prefer a bigger screen compared to the 41mm one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>These Six Materials May Be Blocking Your Home Wifi Signal</title>

      <description>If your signal dies three feet from the router, look for these materials for clues.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNGS4ZAJDA7DKPAHFTN3KXA/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing can ruins your day more thoroughly than a crappy <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-does-wifi-work" target="_blank">wifi signal</a> that slows your entire life to a crawl filled with error messages, broken images, and tedious loading animations that quickly test your sense of reality.</p><p>When that&rsquo;s the situation in your own home, it&rsquo;s even worse&mdash;because it&rsquo;s inescapable. If your <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-boost-your-home-wifi-5931743" target="_blank">wifi signal</a> isn&rsquo;t making it past the room your router sits in, there are several possible explanations&mdash;but you might want to start by considering the stuff your house is made of. Wifi is a radio signal, and when a radio signal passes through a solid material, it weakens&mdash;and certain materials have a bigger impact than others. </p><h2 id="metal">Metal</h2><p>Metal is a good electrical conductor, which means it absorbs radio waves, degrading your wifi signal pretty significantly. Look for these culprits: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Chicken wire. </strong>You might not think there are any metal barriers in your home, but do you know what&rsquo;s inside your walls? Plaster, cement, or stucco walls often use chicken wire or other metal mesh as a reinforcement, essentially turning your walls into wifi-eating machines. Moving your router to a more open location might improve your signal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Appliances and furniture.</strong> <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-case-for-buying-dumb-appliances-1850957723" target="_blank">Appliances</a> like refrigerators or televisions and metal furniture like filing cabinets are big lumps of metal sitting in your house, and if they come between your router and everything else, the signal will have to fight its way through them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doors.</strong> If you have heavy metal doors in the house, those slabs may be gobbling up your wifi signals for breakfast.</p></li></ul><h2 id="glass">Glass</h2><p>Glass itself isn&rsquo;t a problem for wifi signals, but many of the glass stuff in your house also contains metal. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-and-worst-places-to-put-mirrors-in-your-home-1850819977" target="_blank">Mirrors</a>, for example, typically use a thin layer of silver or aluminum to make them reflective, and modern low-emission windows use a thin metallic coating to enhance their insulating properties, which is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/benefits-of-low-e-windows" target="_blank">great for your energy bills</a> but terrible for your wifi signal.</p><h2 id="water-features">Water features</h2><p>Water eats low-frequency radio signals for lunch, because it reacts with them&mdash;that&rsquo;s how a microwave can boil a cup of water so efficiently. You probably didn&rsquo;t put your router at the bottom of a swimming pool, but if you have a large aquarium or other water feature in the home, it will degrade your signal. Water and heating pipes in the walls can also pose a challenge, so having your router on the opposite side of a bathroom, kitchen, or utility room will complicate your coverage.</p><h2 id="concrete-and-brick">Concrete and brick</h2><p>Concrete is dense and challenging for radio signals to pass through, so if your home or apartment has concrete walls and/or floors your wifi signal might go AWOL between the router and, say, your living room television. The problem will be even worse if the concrete is reinforced with metal. </p><p>Brick is less dense than concrete but it&rsquo;s still going to block a lot of that signal. </p><h2 id="ceramic-tile">Ceramic tile</h2><p>Ceramic tile by itself is only a moderate barrier to wifi signals&mdash;but when combined with other materials like drywall or plaster, that ceramic tile becomes a real problem for your internet speeds. If you have a tiled bathroom between your router and the stuff that it feeds, for example, you might experience a significant loss of signal as a result&mdash;possibly worsened by water pipes and other metallic materials in the walls as well.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-have-these-materials-blocking-your-wifi-signal">What to do if you have these materials blocking your wifi signal</h2><p>If your wifi signal sucks and you suspect some of these materials might be to blame, you might not be able (or willing) to tear your home apart to boost your wifi signal&mdash;but being aware of these materials can help you choose the best possible location for your router to remove as many barriers as possible.</p><p>If location is a challenge, look into setting up a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-mesh-networking" target="_blank">mesh networking solution</a>, which can blanket your home with a full-strength wifi signal despite any barriers that exist in the walls or other aspects of the structure. You could also look into running <a href="https://lifehacker.com/is-ethernet-still-worth-it-1850887111" target="_blank">wired internet</a> throughout your home, which is still a perfectly viable solution when it comes to getting internet to your various devices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>If you're in a cleaning, tidying, or organizing rut, let these TV pros inspire and motivate you.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HNB7E3PMHSW663MK4R274QJX/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With TikTok on the verge of disappearing from the U.S., users who look to the app for cleaning inspiration are turning to other mediums like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/best-cleaning-accounts-instagram" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/favorite-youtube-cleaning-influencers" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Don't forget the OG source for streaming entertainment: television! If your laundry is piling up or you have dishes stacked in the sink, you might feel like you have too much to do to relax in front of the boob tube, but TV has long provided some of the best cleaning inspiration around. It could well be that the key to your tidying motivation is streaming some straight-up organizational content. <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/11-of-the-best-home-improvement-shows-and-where-to-str-1849978367" target="">Just as with home renovations</a>, there are loads of great shows about cleaning that can inspire and motivate. </p><h2 id="get-organized-with-the-home-edit"><em>Get Organized With the Home Edit</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-XPg_BE6EA94"></div>
</div>


<p>Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin bring their <em>Home Edit</em> to your home by bringing it to celebrities&rsquo; homes&mdash;and filming it. They help celebs like Reese Witherspoon and Khloe Kardashian organize their homes with their signature approach to form and function and their focus on color-coordinating. <strong>You can stream <em>Get Organized With the Home Edit on </em>Netflix. </strong></p><h2 id="the-gentle-art-of-swedish-death-cleaning"><em>The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-97sG2vKgmb0"></div>
</div>


<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/swedish-death-cleaning-can-improve-your-life-right-now-1850409420" target="_blank">Swedish Death Cleaning</a> is a growing trend centered around preparing your home for your eventual demise. As macabre as that may sound, it's been cropping up more and more <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/best-cleaning-books" target="_blank">in books</a> and now even on TV. An organizer, designer, and psychologist from Sweden help Americans sort out their homes and lives, offering tips for you to do it yourself along the way. <strong>You can stream this show on Peacock.</strong> </p><h2 id="queer-eye"><em>Queer Eye</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-76L9aPDUD0E"></div>
</div>


<p>Since its triumphant relaunch in 2018, <em>Queer Eye </em>has delighted audiences over eight seasons with expert-driven makeovers that span from home to personal style. For home inspo, watch design expert Bobby Berk's (and new interior guru Jeremiah Brent's) renovations, which can get you in the mood to turn your own space into something magical. <strong>Stream <em>Queer Eye </em>on Netflix. </strong></p><h2 id="hot-mess-house"><em>Hot Mess House</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Whxm0vmAoe4"></div>
</div>


<p>Organizing expert Cas Aarssen is the mind behind some of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/clutterbug-styles-cleaning-organizing-home" target="_blank">the cleaning techniques</a> I use every day. She's big on the belief that each person&rsquo;s own organizational style should be embraced, so whether you prefer your stuff hidden or organized visually where you can see it, she has custom tips. She shares those with families on her Discovery+ show and features a variety of homes and room types, so whether you&rsquo;re a visual organizer with a cramped office or a parent who favors an out-of-sight-out-of-mind approach in the playroom, there&rsquo;s inspiration for you here. <strong>Stream <em>Hot Mess House</em> on Discovery+. </strong></p><h2 id="tidying-up-with-marie-kondo"><em>Tidying Up With Marie Kondo</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-WvyeapVBLWY"></div>
</div>


<p>Marie Kondo, creator of the famous <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/the-difference-between-peter-walsh-and-marie-kondos-decluttering-methods" target="_blank">KonMari method</a>, takes a light, optimistic approach to organizing and decluttering. If something doesn&rsquo;t spark joy, you toss it. If it does, you keep it. Her sweet but firm personality and focus on happiness might be just the encouragement you need to tackle that junk drawer. <strong>Stream this show on Netflix. </strong></p><h2 id="worn-stories"><em>Worn Stories</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-l8Vwzt0nUfk"></div>
</div>


<p>If you have a hard time letting go of belongings, you&rsquo;re not alone. It might just help you to see the value other people assign to their clothes, which is what <em>Worn Stories</em> provides. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have tips for decluttering, but it can help you contextualize your own habits and decide what&rsquo;s really worth keeping after all. <strong>Stream <em>Worn Stories </em>on </strong>Netflix.</p><h2 id="the-minimalists-less-is-now"><em>The Minimalists: Less Is Now</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-jn-xbOCZOiQ"></div>
</div>


<p>Another documentary that offers helpful insight is <em>The Minimalists: Less Is Now. </em>Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus advocate for a challenge&mdash;throw one thing out on the first day, two things the next day, and on and on for a full month&mdash;and speak to other people whose lives have been meaningfully changed by embracing minimalism. Maybe you&rsquo;ll join them in shrugging off many of your material possessions for good. (I am a big fan of the Minimalists and regularly include their decluttering techniques when writing about <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/best-decluttering-methods" target="_blank">my favorites</a>.) <strong>You can stream this documentary on Netflix. </strong></p><h2 id="hoarders"><em>Hoarders</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-95AycNj4_3U"></div>
</div>


<p>This show, which has been around for ages, focuses on people whose homes have been completely overtaken by hoarded clutter. That may not describe your situation, but the therapists and organizers who intervene on <em>Hoarders</em> share helpful tips, and the stories of perseverance are inspiring. <strong>You can stream <em>Hoarders </em>on Prime Video, Hulu, and Apple TV. </strong></p><h2 id="stay-here"><em>Stay Here</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Ej9qnDW3kE4"></div>
</div>


<p>In this under-the-radar Netflix show from 2018, designer Genevieve Gorder and real estate pro Peter Lorimer counsel property owners on maximizing the potential of their short-term rental spaces. You can absorb a little business know-how while also getting tips on cleaning and decorating your own home to make it the most appealing it can be. Fantasize about making your space so welcoming and tidy that strangers would pay to stay there, then luxuriate in the fact that <em>you</em> get to enjoy it instead. <strong>You can stream <em>Stay Here</em> on Netflix. </strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Cardio is incredibly important for all of us. It&rsquo;s the bedrock of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126" target="_blank"><u>physical activity guidelines for health</u></a>, and if you already strength train, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-cardio-and-strength-training-are-both-important-1845206358" target="_blank"><u>adding in cardio</u></a> will make you healthier in general <em>and</em> better at the stuff in the gym that you care about. (And no, it <a href="https://lifehacker.com/does-the-cardio-interference-effect-really-slow-your-ga-1846984740" target="_blank"><u>won&rsquo;t kill your gains</u></a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>So where should you begin if you&rsquo;re starting (or re-starting) a cardio habit? The simple answer is that you can do anything that you enjoy, so if your favorite exercise isn&rsquo;t on my list below, but it meets the definition of cardio, you don&rsquo;t need my approval&mdash;just go do it. But if you want some more information about your best options, read on.</p><h2 id="what-counts-as-cardio">What counts as cardio?</h2><p>I have <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/what-counts-as-cardio" target="_blank">another article addressing this question in more detail</a>, but here's the short answer. Cardio exercise is generally understood to be exercise that:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Uses most of your body</strong>, or at least several large muscle groups (cycling &ldquo;only&rdquo; uses your legs, but it absolutely counts).</p></li><li><p><strong>Is rhythmic and repetitive</strong>&mdash;think of the footsteps in jogging, or the arm strokes in swimming.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Can last for 10 minutes or more</strong>. It&rsquo;s fine to do cardio in shorter bursts, but we want to draw a distinction between things like jogging (which people often do for 30 minutes or more) and strength exercises like squats (which might be done for a set of 8 or 12 reps, and then <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-long-you-should-rest-between-sets-1850810654" target="_blank"><u>you need to rest</u></a> before you do more).</p></li><li><p><strong>Is intense enough you feel like you&rsquo;re working</strong>. A leisurely stroll isn&rsquo;t cardio, but <a href="https://lifehacker.com/does-walking-really-count-as-cardio-1846965965" target="_blank"><u>a brisk walk could be</u></a>.</p></li></ul><p>Cardio machines you might see in a typical gym include the treadmill, elliptical, exercise bike (all kinds), rower, and stair climber. Those all count as cardio. Strength training work <em>doesn't</em> count--it's still good for you, but it's a separate thing.</p><h2 id="how-much-cardio-should-i-do">How much cardio should I do?</h2><p>The American Heart Association, the World Health Organization, the CDC, and many other organizations have settled on a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126" target="_blank"><u>guideline</u></a> that says your baseline should be 150 minutes <em>or more</em> of moderate cardio per week. (They often say &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; but if you read the fine print, they are referring specifically to cardio. Strength training is separate.) Specifically, they say you should do:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>150 minutes of moderate cardio per week, <em>or</em>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>75 minutes of vigorous cardio per week, <em>or</em></p></li><li><p>Any combination of the above (adding up to 150, with each minute of vigorous cardio counting double), <em>or</em></p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;re already meeting that baseline easily, you should aim for 300 minutes of moderate/150 minutes vigorous.</p></li></ul><p>What does 150 minutes per week look like? Here are some examples:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>A 30-minute walk every weekday at lunch, <em>or</em></p></li><li><p>A 50-minute session on a spin bike three times a week, <em>or</em></p></li><li><p>22 minutes of brisk walking every morning (even weekends)</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-hard-should-a-cardio-workout-feel">How hard should a cardio workout feel?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re out of breath, feel like you&rsquo;re dying, and can&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s time to stop, you&rsquo;re going harder than you need to. <strong>Moderate cardio</strong> is roughly the same effort level as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-is-zone-2-cardio-and-how-do-i-actually-do-it-1850275966" target="_blank"><u>&ldquo;zone 2&rdquo; cardio</u></a>. It should feel like work, but not torture. You&rsquo;ll be breathing a little heavier than at rest, but you could still easily speak in full sentences. These workouts are easy to recover from (you don&rsquo;t need a rest day afterward) and you&rsquo;ll generally feel better at the end than you did at the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Vigorous cardio</strong> includes everything harder than that, covering the spectrum from a lively jog to really intense intervals. You may feel exhausted at the end of the workout. You may not be able to do this kind of workout every day. Vigorous cardio is good for you, but it&rsquo;s often best in small doses. Endurance athletes (like runners) often aim to keep the harder stuff to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-use-80-20-rule-for-running" target="_blank">20% or less</a> of their weekly workout time.</p><p>While heart rate tracking is popular, I don&rsquo;t recommend using heart rate to tell the difference between your moderate and vigorous workouts, at least if you're a beginner. The heart rate zones that are built into your watch are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-is-zone-2-cardio-its-complicated" target="_blank"><u>inconsistent from device to device</u></a> and they use a formula that is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-calculate-your-max-heart-rate-youre-probably-d-1683716934" target="_blank"><u>often wrong</u></a>. Judge the difference from your breathing and your perceived effort. Moderate cardio is about a 3, maybe 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. </p><h2 id="does-it-matter-what-kind-of-cardio-i-do">Does it matter what kind of cardio I do?&nbsp;</h2><p>Honestly: not that much. Sometimes people seek out cardio that uses their full body, or that targets specific body parts, but that&rsquo;s not actually very important when it comes to the health and fitness benefits. A rowing machine uses your arms more than a spin bike, but both can provide a great cardio workout. If you want to build muscle in your arms, you&rsquo;re better off doing some <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/best-bicep-exercises" target="_blank"><u>strength exercises for your arms</u></a> rather than worrying about whether your cardio workouts include your arms.</p><p>The best cardio workout is whatever you&rsquo;ll do, so the most important factors are how available the workout is to you (is there a rower at your gym?) and preference (do you <em>like</em> rowing?).</p><p>With that huge caveat out of the way, I&rsquo;ll give you guys my favorite cardio workouts, and some tips for working each into your routine.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-cheapest-cardio-workout-running-or-runwalk">The cheapest cardio workout: running (or run/walk)</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s start with what is, for many, the most accessible cardio workout of them all: stepping out of your front door and putting one foot in front of the other. (Nothing is perfect for everybody, of course, so if outdoor workouts don&rsquo;t fit your life, skip to the next section.)&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ll need a pair of shoes that feel reasonably comfortable when you run (they do <em>not</em> have to be expensive running shoes) and many of us will need a sports bra. Then, just add some athletic clothes, and you have the essentials. You&rsquo;ll need the same basic gear for most other exercise, anyway.&nbsp;</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>You do <em>not</em> need a running watch or a heart rate monitor. You don&rsquo;t need to track your mileage or pace at all, although you may find it useful to be vaguely aware of how long your workouts are taking and to track how often you do them. That can be a note in your phone (&ldquo;30 minutes jog Monday&rdquo;) rather than buying into an app or device ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a sample workout, if you don&rsquo;t know where to get started:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Walk for the first 5 minutes, as a warmup. Start slow, and by the end, try to be at a brisk pace.</p></li><li><p>Speed up a bit; try a jog or a fast walk.</p></li><li><p>If you start to feel tired, slow down <em>just a little bit</em>. Don&rsquo;t return to a slow walk unless you truly have to.</p></li><li><p>Speed up again when you feel ready, and repeat.</p></li><li><p>Walk for the last 5 minutes as a cooldown.</p></li></ul><p>Over time, work toward keeping up a steady pace. A slow, steady jog is better (for most of your training) than sprint-and-walk intervals. That said, interval training is a fun thing to sprinkle in. If you&rsquo;re worried that running is boring, try <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-make-running-fun-according-to-reddit" target="_blank"><u>these tips to keep it fun</u></a>.</p><h2 id="easiest-on-your-body-indoor-cycling">Easiest on your body: indoor cycling</h2><p>If I had to crown a best all-around cardio workout, it would probably be spinning. There&rsquo;s a smoother transition between speeds, rather than the distinct categories of &ldquo;walking&rdquo; and &ldquo;running,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s easier to find the right intensity for a given workout. There&rsquo;s not much bouncing or impact, so you may not need a sports bra and you may find it easier on your knees and shins at the start. And you can do it <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/the-real-cost-of-a-peloton" target="_blank"><u>with a water bottle and a fan within reach</u></a>, which makes logistics a bit easier&mdash;no need to carry everything with you.&nbsp;</p><p>(Outdoor cycling is great, by the way. But that requires a helmet, a bit of mechanical know-how, and street smarts to safely mesh with, or avoid, traffic. I&rsquo;m sticking with indoor cycling for my recommendation here, but if you love taking your bike to the streets, by all means enjoy!)</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>There are also tons of options for indoor cycling workouts. You can aim for a straight steady-state workout, perhaps watching a favorite show while you do it on the gym&rsquo;s TV or even your phone. Or you can follow along with a video or audio workout that guides you through intervals while distracting you with music and chatter. Use an app like Peloton or Aaptiv, or find videos on YouTube. Here&rsquo;s one to start you off:&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for jumping rope (even though technically that is &ldquo;equipment&rdquo;) but the pros and cons are similar to jogging. There&rsquo;s a lot of bouncing and impact, and it can be pretty exhausting at first, until you learn how to pace yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we have the staples of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/most-hiit-workouts-arent-really-hiit-1846409560" target="_blank"><u>bodyweight &ldquo;HIIT&rdquo; videos</u></a>, like air squats and jumping jacks. These are fine! But they lend themselves better to intervals, and when we&rsquo;re doing cardio it&rsquo;s good to have options that let us move continuously. That said, I&rsquo;m going to put in a quick plug for the most underrated no-equipment cardio move out there: the old school four-count burpee. (I <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-do-the-perfect-burpee-1826642241" target="_blank"><u>describe it in more detail here</u></a>.) No jump and no pushup. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p><p>But ultimately, if you want to get a good cardio workout in your home without having to buy equipment or clear a big space, just put on some music and dance. And don&rsquo;t tell me you &ldquo;can&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; because you don&rsquo;t need to impress an audience here. Put on something that makes you happy, and shift your weight from one foot to the other. Swing your arms a little. Look! You&rsquo;re dancing! It may not look stylish, but you&rsquo;re getting a workout and you&rsquo;re probably enjoying it a lot more than burpees or squat jumps.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, there are so many directions you can go from here. You can simply bop along to whatever is on the radio or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-reason-spotify-shuffles-aren-t-really-random-and-h-1849756947" target="_blank"><u>shuffle your Spotify</u></a>. You can work on building your skill as a dancer, learning new moves and stringing them together&mdash;don&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eAFCKYe4iw" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>these goofballs</u></a> look like they&rsquo;re having fun dancing the Charleston? You can look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QegSjK9Itbs" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>dance cardio videos</u></a> where an instructor leads you through a workout. Or you can just pick any style you like and have fun with it.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Last year, Microsoft unveiled a new lineup of Surface computers included in its <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-microsoft-copilot" target="_blank"><u>Copilot+ PC Windows AI lineup</u></a>, which Microsoft claims <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-announces-copilot-plus-pcs" target="_blank"><u>are faster than the new M3 MacBooks</u></a>. It runs the Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chip and comes with all the Copilot+ PC perks. Here is how Senior Tech Editor Jake Peterson <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-announces-copilot-plus-pcs" target="_blank"><u>described the</u> Surface Pro</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If you're looking for a machine with a detachable tablet, that's the Surface Pro. The latest 2-in-1 Surface comes in an optional 13-inch OLED configuration, with an ultrawide camera, two USB-4 ports, Wi-Fi 7, and support for outputting to up to three external 4K displays. Notably, you can actually replace many of the parts of the Surface Pro, including the motherboard, battery, and cameras. (What year is this?) Finally, the new Surface Flex Keyboard actually works while detached, so you don't need to physically connect it to the display in order to type.</p></blockquote><p>Lifehacker tech writer David Nield got his hands on one of these Surface Pro 11 and called it "almost the perfect tablet/laptop hybrid" <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-surface-pro-11-review" target="_blank">in his review</a>. </p><p>I've been a loyal customer of the Surface Pro tablets for many years and can attest to their user-friendliness, reliability, and performance. I love being able to use my hands when needed, and turn it into a tablet when using the stylus to take notes, sign documents, or just sketch. You'll get a 13-inch touch LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. Keep in mind you'll still need to buy the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YpVd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=keyboard%20and%20stylus&amp;short_url=a5YpVd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">keyboard and stylus</a> separately.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this point, most of us are aware that&mdash;thanks to a regular stream of data breaches at companies large and small&mdash;at least some of our personal information has inevitably been leaked online. The latest of these involves user location data from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/13/massive-data-breach-exposes-precise-locations-for-users-of-popular-apps/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">ad-serving apps, ranging from</a> Tinder and Grindr to Candy Crush and MyFitnessPal, not to mention VPN apps and various period and pregnancy trackers. </p><p>The leak is the result of a hack at Gravy Analytics, a data broker that collates location data from across mobile devices (including millions of iPhone and Android users) and sells it to other companies. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/gravy-analytics-data-broker-breach-trove-of-location-data-threatens-privacy-millions/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">As TechCrunch reports</a>, the dataset contains more than 30 million location points&mdash;including healthcare clinics, military bases, and government buildings&mdash;for devices around the world. Worse, the data could potentially be de-anonymized and used to track the past movements of individuals.</p><p>The leaked location data was drawn from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ukgd0gIWd9gpV6bOx2pcSHsVO6yIUqbjnlM4ewjO6Cs/edit?gid=1257088277#gid=1257088277" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">hundreds of ad-displaying apps</a>.

For internet browsing, an ad blocker <a href="https://privacybadger.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">like Privacy Badger</a> can prevent ads from loading and displaying on websites and tracking your web activity. </p><p>On mobile, you'll also want to disable mobile advertising identifiers (MAIDs), the data points that can be used to create a map of your device's movement, and limit app tracking permissions.

      <title>These Dutch Ovens Are As Good As Le Creuset (and a Lot Cheaper)</title>

      <description>I may be stirring the pot with this argument, but you don't need a famous brand to cook high-quality meals.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHNB4NCB1A59WBATGMWCEEYJ/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know when the shift occurs, but I know that it happens at some point for everyone: the moment you realize that some generic brands are just as good as the high-end ones. I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;knock-off&rdquo; products impersonating others with lower quality-materials&mdash;more like when you found out that you could buy store-brand ibuprofen instead of Advil. A number of years ago, that&rsquo;s what happened with me and the Le Creuset Dutch oven.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Christmases ago my parents asked what I wanted for a gift. While I&rsquo;d never ask for a full-price $500 Le Creuset Dutch oven, I had caught a phenomenal clearance sale on a terrible color that some store was trying to get rid of. I sent them the link and looked forward to Christmas when I would finally fit in with the kitchen cool kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Leave it to my stepfather to get me the most random Dutch oven. It was blue. There was no embossed Le Creuset&mdash;no name at all, actually. There was an attempt at the famous ombr&eacute; colorway, but they clearly did not use the link I sent them. Classic. So I lugged my 16-pound cast iron pot back to Brooklyn and shoved it in the cabinet to forget about it.</p><p>A year or so later, we were all enduring the woes of lockdown and I turned to my kitchen to make an Irish soda bread. The recipe recommended a Dutch oven and I remembered what I had. Sure, it wasn&rsquo;t a Le Creuset, but I didn&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff much anymore. I placed my lovingly mixed soda bread into the cavity and trusted in the science and alchemy of baking. The loaf that emerged from that cast iron pot was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and tasted&mdash;crusty and browned, fully risen, and tender on the inside.&nbsp;It worked because a Dutch oven is a Dutch oven. </p><h2 id="a-dutch-oven-by-any-other-name">A Dutch oven by any other name</h2><p>You don&rsquo;t need a Le Creuset. You don&rsquo;t. If you have one, that&rsquo;s awesome; they are very pretty. However, if cooking is what you&rsquo;re interested in and you don't have $500 lying around, then there are many other quality, long-wearing, beautiful options out there.</p><p>A Le Creuset Dutch oven, braiser, sauteuse, or any other shape they make, is simply a piece of enameled cast iron cookware. That it&rsquo;s made in France is about the only discernible detail that makes it different from numerous other high-quality enameled cast iron cookware you can buy at a much more affordable price.&nbsp;</p><p>One such brand is <a href="https://www.lodgecastiron.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Lodge</u></a>. I'm a fan. My Lodge cast-iron skillet might be the most dependable piece of cookware I have, honestly. It&rsquo;s made in the U.S., which already brings down the cost, and their cast iron craftsmanship is long-lasting if you <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-properly-care-for-cast-iron-1842089019" target="_blank">take care of it properly</a>.</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>But you don&rsquo;t even have to buy a Lodge Dutch oven (though it&rsquo;s hard to beat the value). When you&rsquo;re shopping for enameled cast iron cookware, after you find the size and color you like, make sure to check the specifications on temperature. Enameled cast-iron cookware should be broiler-safe, and able to withstand temperatures 500&deg;F or even higher without a lid. (Sometimes the handle on the lid can only go up to 450&deg;F or 500&deg;F, so check the details.) Here are a couple others that might fit nicely in your kitchen.&nbsp;</p><div class="shadow-b-2 mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-[#F0F0F0] px-6 py-2 shadow-lg md:px-12" role="region" aria-label="Products List" x-data="{ showMore: false }">

<p>I&rsquo;ve tossed everything from breads to stews to deep-frying oil into my six-quart Dutch oven. It&rsquo;s been a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/holiday-cocktail-batching" target="_blank"><u>batch cocktail</u></a> <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/dutch-oven-as-cooler" target="_blank"><u>drink chiller</u></a> for my Christmas parties, and a place where I hide bread from my cats. That random, brand-free Dutch oven is a perfect kitchen tool, and shame on me for caring about a brand name. In fact, if I had received a Le Creuset, there&rsquo;s a good chance I would have coddled it instead of throwing it on flames over and over again, like you should do with a Dutch oven. Brand name or no, a Dutch oven is an easy-to-clean, no-seasoning-necessary kitchen workhorse. It&rsquo;s meant to be used.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bing Isn’t Tricking People Into Thinking They’re Using Google Anymore</title>

      <description>Microsoft has stopped sending searches for "Google" to a spoofed Google UI.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JH136VD1X3XXYFQKCEQM7MBD/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In well over a decade of journalism, I've seen a fair amount of copied designs, but I've never seen anything as blatant as Bing's recently abandoned attempt to hoodwink people into believing they were actually using Google. </p><p>Since time immemorial, people have used a system's default apps to look for better alternatives, and to switch to those instead. Back in the day, Internet Explorer was often used to download Firefox or Chrome, before being forgotten forever. Now, the same thing is happening with Bing&mdash;Microsoft's search engine&mdash;and the company clearly isn't pleased about it.</p><p>If you use Microsoft's Edge browser and haven't changed any of its default settings, Bing is your search engine. Earlier this month, when you typed the word "Google" into that browser's address bar, you would see a page that you may have mistaken for a Google search, but you'd actually still be on Bing. The illusion came complete with a fake Google doodle, a search bar with Google-like text underneath it, results laid out in a way that aped Google's design, and other spoofed Google UI elements. This was first <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/06/bing-trick-users-google/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">spotted by 9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The worst part was that the spoofed page even hid Microsoft Bing's branding by automatically scrolling past it. Normally, Bing's branding and the search bar are prominently visible at the top of every search.</p><p>A few weeks later (and after the practice garnered a whole lot of attention, from this website and others), the charade seems to be over: Searching for "Google" on Bing now takes you to a standard Bing results page. But it's clear that they attempted this scheme at all that Microsoft has noticed that people are using Bing to locate Google, and isn't happy about that. </p><p>Parisa Tabriz, the vice president of Google Chrome, expressed her displeasure at the move <a href="https://x.com/laparisa/status/1876343944700887223" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">on X</a> (formerly Twitter).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an active TikTok user, I have been trying to ignore the impending reality of next week&rsquo;s <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-ban-news" target="_blank"><u>closure</u></a>. While my fingers are crossed for a last minute save, and I still plan to try to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-tiktok-if-its-banned-in-the-us" target="_blank"><u>use it after</u></a> the 19th, yesterday I began the process of preserving all my data. If you&rsquo;re a TikTok user, you should, too. Here&rsquo;s how.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="download-your-likes-favorites-and-follows">Download your likes, favorites, and follows</h2><p>My three main concerns before the ban are making sure I have <strong>a list of people I follow</strong>, so I can follow them elsewhere, <strong>grabbing videos I&rsquo;ve bookmarked</strong> since they probably had some utility, and <strong>saving my own videos</strong>. TikTok is the best place to start, since they have a built in feature that gives you all of that data as a document. You can request a data download of all your personal settings including your likes, followers, follows, bookmarks, and a list of your posts. Note: this does not include any actual videos; it&rsquo;s more an inventory for you to work off of.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To request this data, go to your profile, and click on the menu from the upper right hand side. Go to <strong>Settings</strong><em> </em><strong>and Privacy &gt; Account &gt; Download your data</strong>. Note that you can select what types of data you want to download and what format you want it in (text file or JSON). A text file is more useful right now, since it will output your information in a format you can easily access, but having a JSON file might enable you to work with future utilities to help import follows and likes to another platform, so I recommend grabbing both formats of data. This means going through this exercise twice. Once for the text file, once for the JSON file (a computer language) to store in case some TikTok replacement can use it in the future to make importing follows or likes easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the file is ready, you&rsquo;ll need to verify an SMS code sent to the phone number on record for the account to download the file. While you&rsquo;ll likely conduct this operation on your phone, once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the file, locate it in your file manager and click on &ldquo;Share&rdquo; and then email it to yourself.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-to-save-your-own-videos">How to save your own videos</h2><p>The most painful (but cost effective) way to save your own videos is to simply visit each of them and download individually. Once the video is open from your profile, click the three dots in the lower right corner and select &ldquo;Download Video.&rdquo; If it sounds labor intensive, it is.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a confident coder with some JSON experience, you can use a free tool a TikToker built that they&rsquo;ve open sourced on <a href="https://github.com/samirelanduk/tiktok-save" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>GitHub</u></a>. You'll need that JSON file for this method to work. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A simpler solution was <a href="https://www.tokbackup.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Tokbackup</u></a>, a web utility that you can use from your desktop. For $5 a month, you can download up to 6,000 videos for up to three profiles (higher priced plans allow for more profiles). You can use this utility to download all the videos of any profile, not just your own, so while it won&rsquo;t save all your favorite videos, if you love one particular creator, this is a reasonable solution to grab all their videos to rewatch at home. Tokbackup took about ten minutes to grab all 100 of my videos, and I was pleased to see the data download included my most frequent hashtags, as well. Once the utility had grabbed them, you click on &ldquo;download&rdquo; to save a zipped file to your hard drive. For 100 videos, my file was almost 4GB, so you may want to find someplace in the cloud to park the file. Once downloaded, remember to cancel your account so you don&rsquo;t get charged next month.&nbsp;</p><p>There are additional tools, like <a href="http://Repurpose.io" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Repurpose.io</u></a>, which will reportedly download all your videos for you, and even crosspost them to other platforms, but at a <a href="https://repurpose.io/pricing/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>steep cost</u></a> ($349 for the year).&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-to-save-your-favorited-or-liked-videos">How to save your favorited or liked videos</h2><p>If you&rsquo;d specifically like to grab videos from other people that you liked or favorited, you can download them individually, as noted above. However, I had luck using the <a href="https://myfavett.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>MyFaveTT</u></a> extension for Chrome, which is free.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Once installed, open it and connect to TikTok on the desktop. From there, you select whether you&rsquo;d like to save your liked or favorited videos, and designate a location for them on your hard drive. This was a pretty seamless process, and over the course of an hour, all my bookmarked videos were saved. Depending on how many videos this is, it could take up hefty resources on your hard drive, so as above, you may want to have someplace online to park the videos until you need them.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

      <description>There are ways to keep a low profile online, even in public.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even when on social media, you might not feel like being particularly sociable&mdash;even with family and friends who you're actually quite fond of. Maybe you don't want parents (or kids) snooping on your activities. Perhaps you'd rather not have long-lost school friends looking you up. Or maybe you just want to keep an online space that's separate from your offline life.</p><p>For these reasons and any others, you can make your social media profiles less discoverable than they would otherwise be. The big networks give you control over who can find you and who can't, so you're less likely to pop up in the "people you may know" feed of your uncle or your neighbor from down the street. Here are some tips for making yourself less findable on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media sites.</p><h2 id="general-tips-for-any-social-media-network">General tips for any social media network</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Generally speaking, there are a few rules you can follow on whatever social platform you're on&mdash;though obviously you'll need to work within the platform's policies on user ID verification. First, when you sign up, offer up as little accurate personal information as you can get away with: You might want to use an alternative name, for example, and an alternative profile picture that's something other than your face.</p><p>Social networks often suggest connections based on who's in your phone contacts, so if you can avoid giving your phone number, do so (or use an alternative number, if you have one). You'll almost certainly need to supply an email address, but you can enter a secondary one that no one else has, or use one of the many burner email address services that are now available (such as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-get-a-burner-email-address-with-icloud-s-hide-my-1847553382" target="_blank">Apple's Hide my Email</a>).</p><p>Decline any prompts to find connections and contacts when you sign up, and don't give the app permission to scan your phone's contact lists. If you have to choose a handle, avoid your real name or anything that would identify you. What's more, on most networks, there's nothing to stop you creating a second account, if you want to. If you've already got a "real" account in place, then add an extra one with different personal details that you can use on the down low.</p><h2 id="how-to-stay-hidden-on-instagram">How to stay hidden on Instagram</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can of course make your Instagram private&mdash;so zero other people can see your posts unless you approve their request to connect. You can choose the private option during account setup, or switch to it later in the app by switching to your profile tab, tapping the menu button (three lines, top right), then choosing <strong>Account privacy &gt; Private account</strong>.</p><p>On the same screen there's an <strong>Allow profile picture expansion</strong> toggle switch: Turn this off to prevent other users taking a closer look at your profile picture. Back on the main menu, you can choose <strong>Tags and mentions</strong> to control who else is allowed to tag and mention you on the platform. You're able to disable this entirely, restrict it to only people you follow, and switch on manual tag reviewing if you want.</p><p>There's another option to talk about, but it's not in the mobile apps&mdash;you have to head to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Instagram on the web</a> to find it. Click <strong>Profile</strong>, then <strong>Edit Profile</strong>, and you'll find a toggle switch labeled <strong>Show account suggestions on profiles</strong>.

<p>Since <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stop-your-contacts-from-finding-your-twitter-pro-1848491997" target="_blank">we last wrote</a> about stopping people finding you on Twitter, the site has changed its name to X and Elon Musk has started running the show&mdash;but a lot of the same settings are still in place. As with Instagram, you can make your profile private (for approved connections only). This can be done either during setup or through the app by tapping your profile picture (top left), then <strong>Settings &amp; Support &gt; Settings and privacy &gt; Privacy and safety &gt; Audience and tagging &gt; Protect your posts</strong>.</p><p>From the <strong>Privacy and safety</strong> menu you can also choose <strong>Discoverability and contacts</strong>. There are three key features you can turn off on the next screen: Allowing other people to find you via your email address, allowing other people to find you via your phone number, and syncing your phone contacts with X to suggest connections. Disable all of them and you'll be much harder to find.</p><p>It's also a good idea to head into <strong>Direct messages</strong> from <strong>Privacy and safety</strong>, and get everything here set up as you want it. The X platform gives you plenty of control when it comes to who's allowed to message you and call you, and you can shut down these features entirely if needed. It's another precaution that reduces the chance of someone you don't want to speak to getting in touch.</p><h2 id="how-to-stay-hidden-on-facebook">How to stay hidden on Facebook</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Either way, you'll be happy to know that the Mac has a built-in feature that can merge multiple different sound outputs&mdash;no third-party app needed. You can easily use two sets of Bluetooth headphones to listen to the same audio, without any noticeable audio drift or lag. </p><h2 id="first-connect-both-devices-to-bluetooth">First, connect both devices to Bluetooth</h2><p>The first step is to connect both devices to your Mac using Bluetooth.

      <title>What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: How the LA Fires Started</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHKN1434CR4NTQ2RBK99AWPG</guid>

      <description>In the immortal words of Frankenstein's monster, "Fire bad."</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHKN1434CR4NTQ2RBK99AWPG/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Jan. 7, a deadly combination of dry conditions and unusually strong winds caused a series of wildfires in Los Angeles. The fires then ignited a cultural wildfire of internet ignorance, conspiracy theories, and misinformation that has been burning out of control online. It's been over a week, and neither the fires nor the fake news have been contained. </p><p>Much of the mythology around the LA fires revolves around who or what started the deadly conflagrations. It's an understandable question, but there are no useful answers more specific than "the weather" right now. </p><p>People are not patient enough to wait for investigations to conclude and lawsuits to be resolved&mdash;they can't even wait for the flames to die down&mdash; so they're filling in the gaps by casting blame on the groups or things they hate the most. </p><h2 id="the-people-i-dont-like-set-the-fires">"The people I don't like set the fires"</h2><p>The list of culprits is long and peculiar. Here are only some of the people and things being erroneously or prematurely blamed for starting the LA fires.</p><p><strong>The Jews</strong>: Fan-favorite conspiracy theory "The Jews did it" made an early appearance after the fire. This was posted on Facebook on Jan. 8:</p><div class="facebookEmbed facebook-embed text-center mb-4">
            <div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.aguilar.1422/posts/pfbid033U7pNQb1k7AMSjkShvmpSpDTscfHMTtzSGW95Pny2eHBPnMMGDBqeGZ4VHQ5MePhl" data-show-text="true" data-width="">

<p>"Just dew it" is a reference to "directed energy weapons," aka Jewish space lasers. But alas, this Facebook post contains a photo from a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/holding-out-slim-hope-as-crews-search-for-more-fire-dead/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">different fire from 2018</a>, so it doesn't prove anything. That some <a href="https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/standing-trees-after-la-fires-are-not-evidence-laser-attack-2025-01-14/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">trees didn't burn</a> doesn't prove it was lasers either. The ancillary theory that <a href="https://x.com/exoter56/status/1878716186575401005" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">homes with blue roofs and/or blue bins</a> aren't targeted by Jewish space lasers isn't true either, but just in case, make sure you recycle.</p><p>To be fair, it's not impossible to use "directed energy" to start a fire&mdash;you can do it yourself with a magnifying glass&mdash;but there's no evidence that this was the cause of the LA fires. A book of matches would be more efficient tool anyway. </p><p><strong>Woke people/Democrats:</strong> There are a <em>lot</em> of conspiracy theories that blame the fires on the general wokeness of California's government. That these are cheap attempts to politicize a tragedy seems obvious to me, but I'm not the target audience for claims like these. Anyway, California <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oregon-fire-trucks-turned-away-from-la-smog/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">didn't turn away 40 firetrucks from Oregon</a> for not meeting emissions standards. It's also not true that LA <a href="https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1877428450027266503" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">sent its firefighting equipment to Ukraine.</a>  Donald Trump claimed California governor Gavin Newsom failed to sign a "water restoration declaration," but <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/debunking-5-claims-california-wildfires/story?id=117549503" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">that isn't actually a thing</a>. James Woods, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1877224004680843539" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>, and many others claim that the LAFD's diversity program is to blame for a less-than-adequate response to the fire, which is maybe a matter of opinion, but there's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/debunking-5-claims-california-wildfires/story?id=117549503" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">no evidence to back it up</a>. </p><p>I'm not discounting the possibility that governmental mismanagement or bad public policy affected the response to the fires&mdash;nobody's perfect, right?&mdash;but it's too early to tell what, if anything, went wrong, and who, if anyone, screwed the pooch. There will be years of lawsuits to straighten it all out, rest assured. </p><p><strong>MAGA Republicans</strong>: A post on Threads (<a href="https://archive.ph/193Ay" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">archived here</a>) from Jan. 8 claims that the LAPD are "looking for three 'persons of interest,' all tied to a MAGA website and who were spotted at the source of all three major LA fires." This is <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/09/threads-posts/los-angeles-wildfires-threads-post-falsely-claims/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">not true.</a> Like it's fully made-up. </p><p><strong>Illegal immigrants</strong>: This one is at least plausible. In the days after the fire, LA police <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/us-news/kenneth-fire-in-west-hollywood-hills-being-probed-as-arson-1-in-custody-reports/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">arrested a homeless</a> citizen of Mexico who was carrying a blowtorch. But whether the blowtorch was used to set fires hasn't been determined. Could it have been understandably nervous local residents mistaking a drug-smoking blowtorch for a fire-starting blowtorch? Maybe. In any case, <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/statement-ice-person-interest-being-held-connection-california-fires" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">ICE is looking into it</a>, and if this undocumented dude was really was starting fires, rest assured, we will never, ever stop hearing about it. </p><p><strong>Kids smoking weed</strong>: 24-year-old hiker Beni Oren posted a series of harrowing videos of himself and his friends running from the Palisades fire shortly after it began, leading to widespread <a href="https://x.com/texasrepublik/status/1878673215326986722" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">comment section speculation </a>that those kids were smoking weed up there, and that's what started the fire. Many helpful X users also pointed out that <a href="https://x.com/libertymama86/status/1878760568385151003" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">"Oren" is a Jewish name</a>. There is no evidence that Oren or his friends were anything but hikers caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. That could change, of course, but for now, that's all we know.  </p><p><strong>Unspecified people (who are probably the Jews)</strong>: During a <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1877873979496808709" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Fox News interview, actor Mel Gibson</a> claimed that "there were people ready and willing and able to start fires and are they commissioned to do so." Because he's Mel Gibson, I assume he's talking about the Jews, but you never know. </p><p><strong>Global warming</strong>: <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Global climate change is definitely real,</a> but whether this specific fire (or any fire) was "caused" by climate change is complex question. On one hand, there were wildfires in California <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/a-recipe-for-ancient-wildfires/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">before there were humans on earth</a>, but on the other, wildfires are more destructive and more frequent now than they were even <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc0020" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">30 years ago.</a> Climate change probably amplified the weather conditions that made this fire so devastating, but does that mean global warming "caused" the fire? I guess it depends on what you mean by "caused."</p><p><strong>Enthusiastic urban planners: </strong>According to <a href="https://x.com/TPV_John/status/1876881137772990953" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">this poster on X</a>, "by 2028, LA is poised to be a fully operational AI based 'Smart City,'" and the fire was set to drive away people so the AI could take over. </p><p>Similar "concerns" were voiced by Fox News host Laura Ingram, who said, "There's already talk&mdash;and we played a couple of sound bites&mdash;of reimagining the way rebuilding occurs, and obviously there's a great need for high-density housing in California and across the country, that's a big push by the climate folks, and you're already hearing rumblings of that in this case. Like, goodbye single-family homes, hello high-density housing."</p><p>Ingram doesn't specify who "the climate folks" nor does she detail the "rumblings" she heard. She seems purposefully vague about the details so viewers can fill in the blanks themselves. No one can really say she's wrong exactly, but the insinuation is that some shadowy group purposefully set the fires to achieve their nefarious goal of available affordable housing.</p><p><strong>Diddy</strong>: According to this conspiracy theory, someone set the LA fires to cover up evidence of crimes connected to P. Diddy. Among the proponents of the "Diddy did it" theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Austin_Fitts" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Catherine Austin Fitts,</a> who served as the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under George H.W. Bush. While this is possible, a huge fire seems like a wildly ineffective tool for evidence destruction. </p><h2 id="so-what-really-caused-the-la-fires">So what <em>really</em> caused the LA fires?</h2><p>In a broad sense, the LA fires were the result of unprecedented high winds and dry conditions. The Santa Ana winds are a semi-annual event, and high winds in California usually result in fires. Small blazes that would be quickly extinguished on a normal day become huge wildfires when it gets windy enough.</p><p>To be fair to Nature, most of those small blazes are caused by people. Human activity is directly responsible for <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">85% of wildfires</a>, whether it's electric lines being blown down or arson. As for the current fires: There's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/palisades-fire-origin-new-years-eve-fire/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> that the Palisades Fire was caused when the remnants of an older blaze reignited, and the Eaton Fire could have been set off by an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-eaton-cause-utility-fireworks-eb0f4f71e437f1ba692f929e9633c856" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">electric company's equipment</a>, but until The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives finishes its investigation and releases its findings, we have no solid evidence of who or what caused the fires. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tested tons of health and fitness apps over the years&mdash;some to write about, some because I was curious, and some because they are genuinely useful to me. Here is my Fitness App Hall of Fame: the fitness apps that I use the most, and the ones that I think are the most useful for everybody.&nbsp;All of these apps are available on both iOS and Android.</p><h2 id="the-best-apps-for-tracking-nutrition-cronometer-and-macrofactor">The best apps for tracking nutrition: Cronometer and Macrofactor</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I&rsquo;m including two apps here because one (Macrofactor) only works if you pay for a subscription. I&rsquo;m a happy subscriber, but for those looking for a free option, I can wholeheartedly recommend Cronometer.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWwR6l?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Cronometer&amp;short_url=QWwR6l&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Cronometer</a> is a nutrition tracker that, unlike certain more popular apps (coughMFPcough), just does its job and stays out of your way. Don&rsquo;t want to see a calorie goal on your main screen? You can hide it. Want to scan the barcodes on food packages? That&rsquo;s a free feature. (There&rsquo;s a premium tier that gives you even more features, of course, but none of the essentials are hidden behind it.)</p><p>By the way: Make sure to either follow my link or to check the spelling if you&rsquo;re typing the name into the app store. There is at least one other app with a confusingly similar name.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Based on that, it estimates your total daily calorie burn, without you having to log any exercise or worry about how accurate your wearable is. If you&rsquo;re eating 2,300 calories and your weight is steady, you know that your body burns 2,300 calories per day.&nbsp;</p><p>MacroFactor costs $11.99 per month, or about $71.99 for a year. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-i-learned-from-tracking-my-calorie-burn-for-a-year-1849632112" target="_blank"><u>I learned a ton from tracking my calorie burn with MacroFactor</u></a>, and I highly recommend it if you are OK with calorie tracking and are interested in gaining weight, losing weight, or fueling appropriately for exercise.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-best-app-for-tracking-your-runs-strava">The best app for tracking your runs: Strava</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you have a wearable you like, the matching app is probably the best one for the nuts and bolts of daily workout tracking. (That would be Garmin Connect if you have a Garmin watch, Fitbit if you have a Fitbit or a Pixel watch, and so on.) But <a href="https://www.strava.com/mobile" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Strava</a> collects the data from any wearable (or none at all&mdash;you can enter runs manually) and shows you maps and statistics, <em>plus</em> lets you know what your friends have been up to.&nbsp;</p><p>This recommendation comes with a caveat: If you want to maintain your privacy&mdash;and especially if you run in places where there aren&rsquo;t many other runners&mdash;you&rsquo;ll want to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/stravas-heatmap-privacy-problem" target="_blank"><u>be aware of Strava&rsquo;s privacy issues</u></a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/9-strava-settings-you-should-change-to-keep-your-fitnes-1848979818" target="_blank"><u>lock down your settings</u></a> if you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with the defaults.

<p>There are lots of ways to find workouts to follow along with, including <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-train-for-a-race-with-garmins-training-plans" target="_blank"><u>getting workouts from a wearable like a Garmin</u></a>, or subscribing to a service like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-get-started-with-apple-fitness-1846796643" target="_blank"><u>Apple Fitness+</u></a> or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-for-running-review" target="_blank"><u>Peloton</u></a>.

<p>My caveat for this recommendation is that I don&rsquo;t use a strength training app on the regular. I get workouts from my real-life coach through a coaching app that my gym uses, and I keep track of all the important stuff in a paper <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-set-up-a-training-journal-in-a-paper-notebook" target="_blank"><u>training journal</u></a>. But I&rsquo;ve experimented with enough strength training apps that I know which ones are out there, and I definitely have a favorite: It&rsquo;s Hevy.&nbsp;</p><p>When I <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-pixel-watch-3-vs-garmin-vivoactive" target="_blank"><u>tested the fitness-tracking abilities of the Pixel Watch 3</u></a>, I found that the Hevy watch app was miles better than any of the watch&rsquo;s native strength-training features. It won&rsquo;t track your heart rate, which is a <em>good</em> thing. But it does give you a wrist-based interface to track the lifts you&rsquo;re doing, and the watch app updates the phone app and vice versa. Hevy also works with the iPhone and Apple Watch, and of course you can use it just on a phone.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.hevyapp.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Hevy</a> lets you plan out your routine. It can time your rests, if you like. It will keep track of your progress and show you how you&rsquo;ve gotten stronger over time. There&rsquo;s even a desktop version so you can see your workouts on a computer screen for more detailed planning.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-best-app-for-monitoring-injuries-and-health-issues-bearable">The best app for monitoring injuries and health issues: Bearable</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Everybody hurts sometimes, as the philosophers R.E.M. once told us. Sometimes we get hurt while working out, or sometimes we get aches and pains out of nowhere and have to work around them when we exercise. In some cases, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-your-back-hurts-and-what-you-can-do-about-it-1850289525" target="_blank"><u>especially with back pain</u></a>, how we feel may be dependent on all kinds of things in our daily life. Maybe your back pain is better on days you exercise, for example, and worse on days you have a lot of stress at work.</p><p>Keeping track of those factors in your head can be difficult, but I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://bearable.app/symptom-tracker/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Bearable</a> to be helpful. You can decide what you&rsquo;d like to track each day&mdash;like how stressed you are, and whether you did your physical therapy exercises&mdash;and rate how much that sore back (or whatever) is bothering you. Patterns quickly emerge. When I was using it, I found it really encouraging to see that my pain wasn&rsquo;t <em>always</em> so bad, and that there really were things in my control that helped me to feel better.&nbsp;It's not limited to injuries, either&mdash;you can use it to track chronic health issues or even mental health. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Some TikTok Users Are Fleeing to RedNote, Another Chinese Social Media App</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHK2A4M563XSKTS4Z71HFCEP</guid>

      <description>"Xiaohongshu" is currently the most popular free app in the U.S.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHK2A4M563XSKTS4Z71HFCEP/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-ban-news" target="_blank">TikTok's future in the United States is looking more uncertain than ever</a>. With a potential ban just days away, angry TikTok users are looking for alternatives&mdash;and they're not all turning to American-based platforms like Instagram.</p><p>Instead, these users, who dub themselves "<a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-happens-after-tiktok-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">TikTok refugees</a>," are looking to stick it to the U.S. government, who is trying to ban their favorite app over issues of national security. TikTok's parent company is ByteDance, which is based in China. As such, the TikTok refugees are largely targeting social media platforms that are also run by companies based in China. </p><p>An app called RedNote is one of the most prominent options getting attention. Perhaps that's an understatement: As of this writing, RedNote is the number one app on both the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.</p><h2 id="what-is-rednote">What is RedNote?</h2><p>RedNote's Chinese name is Xiaohongshu, which translates to "Little Red Book." (Also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34932800" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the name of the collection of writings of Chinese political revolutionary Mao Zedong</a>.) It's a popular social media app in its native country, created in 2013 by developer Xingyin Information Technology. It is similar to, but not an exact replica of TikTok. </p><p>Like TikTok, RedNote hosts short-form videos you can scroll through endlessly. But in addition to videos, the app also lets you create collaborative "boards," and even shop in its in-app marketplace&mdash;though I'm not sure what the shipping costs would be to buy used furniture from across the world. At the end of the day, it's a social media experience, one that the U.S. government probably didn't anticipate would play host to disgruntled Americans. </p><p>Of course, what's drawing the crowds are RedNote's TikTok-like short videos. I downloaded the app to see what the hullabaloo is all about. </p><h2 id="what-data-rednote-asks-for-when-you-install-it">What data RedNote asks for when you install it</h2><p>As far as privacy and security goes, the app will scrape your device ID, and developer Xingin can potentially use that to track you across other apps and websites. That's not great, but it's also not unusual: For context, TikTok also tracks your device ID, as well as your email address and phone number&mdash;two data points RedNote does not track. RedNote also collects other data points that are linked directly to you, including your purchases, search history, user ID, and contacts. Finally, the app takes a number of data points that are not directly linked to you, including your advertising data, product interaction, coarse location, product interaction, precise location, physical address, name, phone number, photos or videos, audio data, customer support info, user content, crash data, and performance data. </p><p>It's worth noting again that plenty of apps ask for data points like this, both linked and not linked to your identity. It's your choice what you're comfortable with offering up, and there are always steps to take to prevent certain data from leaking from your device to the app. For example, you can use a VPN to mask your location and device ID, or disable your location settings for the app altogether; create an account through Apple and use Hide My Email to shield your email address from the app; disable photos and videos access for the app, except for specific pictures and clips you choose to share; and block the app from accessing your contacts, if you'd rather find your friends there one-by-one. </p><h2 id="what-its-like-using-rednote-as-an-english-speaker">What it's like using RedNote as an English speaker</h2><p>As I scroll through the app, it largely looks like TikTok meets the Instagram Explore page. Indeed, RedNote's main feed is called "Explore," a grid layout of different videos you can check out. Tap one, and it plays. Scroll down, and you can watch another video. If you've used a short-form video platform before, you'll get the gist pretty quick. In fact, there's a dedicated "Trending" tab, that is your basic short-form video experience. Of course, there are some feature unique to RedNote: Pinch in, and you clear the UI, to focus on the video at hand. Long-press, and you'll find a series of extra options, including "Auto scroll," if scrolling by hand gets to be too much.</p><p>In most respects, this is a short-form video app that anyone who has watched TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts can understand quickly&mdash;perhaps minus actually reading a lot of the writing in it. Not only is the developer of this app based in China, the primary language of the app itself is reportedly Mandarin, which means most of the discourse on it is not in English. If you, like me, do not know a word of Chinese, you may miss out on things as you scroll through comments and captions in a language you don't understand. </p><p>Of course, there are ways to translate elements of your display, but you might not have to: Part of the quirk of so many English-speaking American users flooding the app is that the Chinese-speaking users are now posting in English as well. Users from both countries have even been chatting and joking with one another: Chinese-based users are posting in English, saying that they're happy to see Americans, <a href="https://x.com/MissGinaDarling/status/1878653687192842562" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">as their jobs as their "Chinese spies" will be saved</a>. (Others are <a href="https://www.twitter.com/MissGinaDarling/status/1878881110664568935" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">asking Americans for help with their English homework</a>.) In general, users from both countries seem to be having a good time getting to know one another. </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>As much buzz as RedNote is getting this week, it's obviously nowhere near as popular as TikTok, even in China: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/xiaohongshu-rednote-chinas-answer-to-instagram-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store-as-tiktok-faces-us-shutdown/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The former has 300 million active users</a>, compared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/business/china-tiktok-house-bill.html#:~:text=TikTok%20wields%20wide%20influence%20in,billion%20users%20across%20140%20countries." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TikTok's one <em>billion</em></a>. But should TikTok be banned in the U.S. next week, the app may lose its 170 million American users&mdash;at least the ones that <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-tiktok-if-its-banned-in-the-us" target="_blank">don't use workarounds to keep the app alive</a>. It will be interesting to see how RedNote continues to grow, and whether that growth will in turn inspire the U.S. government to try to ban it as well. If the TikTok ban is successful, it's not hard to see a RedNote ban become a reality, too. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Reverse Sear the Best Steak of Your Life</title>

      <description>More even browning and better control over its "doneness."</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J47VZ6V4X69SCS7BDSW2HJ7Q/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to hate cooking steak at home for one big reason: the smoke. I rent an apartment in Brooklyn, which means I have to deal with a close and sensitive smoke alarm. But even without the threat of a piercing siren, steak was always one of those &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; foods that ended up making more of a mess than I care to clean up. </p><p>That is, until the concept of reverse searing entered my life, and changed everything. Now I can make myself a perfect steak, and you can too.</p><h2 id="what-is-reverse-searing">What is reverse searing?</h2><p>Searing is the classic way to prepare a steak: simply pop it in a screaming hot pan and sear it until it&rsquo;s done. &ldquo;Reverse searing&rdquo; is the catchy phrase for baking a roast low and slow in a conventional oven, and tossing it in a hot pan <em>afterward</em> to get some nice color on the outside. The steak effectively cooks almost completely in the oven; you pan-sear it simply for the glorious browning and flavor the process brings.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="you-can-reverse-sear-almost-any-steak">You can reverse sear (almost) any steak</h2><p>You can use this method for almost any type of steak or roast. You can reverse sear rib-eye steaks, filet mignon, New York strip steak, or a pork tenderloin. The only caveat is thickness: It's hard to reverse sear anything thinner than an inch thick&mdash;between the baking and searing, a thin cut of meat will likely cook past the medium-rare point before you can catch it. Try to aim for steaks and roasts that are an inch and a half or thicker. </p><h2 id="reverse-searing-is-totally-worth-it">Reverse searing is totally worth it</h2><p>Reverse searing helps the steak to brown more evenly than simply pan searing. Searing a steak over high heat will cook the protein fibers on the outside much more rapidly, shrinking the outer layer and causing the middle to bulge, and that warping of the meat makes it hard to get an even sear. Searing is primarily to add flavor, so an uneven sear actually minimizes flavor.&nbsp;</p><p>Reverse searing cooks the meat gently and slowly. Most often, you'll start the process with an oven set to 225&deg;F or 250&deg;F, and leave the steak in there for 20 to 50 minutes, depending on how you like your steak (and a few variables I will discuss later). Slow cooking allows the meat to warm up and heat through more evenly, keeping its shape nice and flat. The best part, if you ask me? No smoke. There is no opportunity for scorching when using this cooking technique. Well, not yet anyway. (You do sear it briefly at the end, but it&rsquo;s for no where near as long.) </p><p>Moreover, it&rsquo;s lower stress: Cooking this way allows you to do other things in the kitchen while the steak cooks away in the oven, and you can use a probe thermometer every 10 minutes or so to see how it&rsquo;s coming along. If you have a terrible habit of overcooking your steak, this method nearly guarantees you won&rsquo;t overcook it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-right-way-to-reverse-sear-a-steak">The right way to reverse sear a steak</h2><p>A dryer surface sears better, so the evening before you're ready to cook, pat your steak with some paper towels and let it sit on a wire rack over a sheet pan in the fridge overnight. If you forget to do this, you can simply do it in the morning for a few hours. Worse case scenario (which has certainly happened to me several times), just pat it dry before you put it in the oven. </p><h3>1. Preheat your oven</h3><p>Set your oven to 250&deg;F. Place a wire rack over a sheet pan. There won&rsquo;t be much that drips off the steak, but elevating the meat allows the warm air to flow around all sides.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>2. Set your target temp and bake the steak</h3><p>Thoroughly season your steak and place it on the wire rack. You&rsquo;re aiming for an internal temperature 10 to 15 degrees <em>below</em> the target finished temperature. Consider that the steak will sear in a hot pan, and also experience carry-over cooking.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a chart with target temperatures that the center of your steak should reach before you sear it in a pan. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I like my steak around medium which is about 140&deg;F. I subtracted 15 degrees, and aimed for 125&deg;F -ish. It took me 45 minutes to get to 122&deg;F, with two temperature tests after the first 25 minutes. </p><p>There are variables to keep in mind. How thick is your steak? Was it fridge-cold or room temperature? My ribeye was one-and-a-half inches thick, and still chilly from the fridge. After 25 minutes, it had just reached the internal temperature fit for a rare steak, about 102&deg;F. My advice is to keep in mind the thickness of your steak and check on it after 10 minutes for a thin steak (around an inch and a quarter thick), and after 20 or 25 minutes for a thicker one (an inch and a half or more). Once you have an initial reading, you can adjust the cooking time from there.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>3. Sear in a hot pan</h3><p>Once your target internal temperature has been reached, remove the steak from the oven. Heat a frying pan, or cast iron skillet on medium heat until it&rsquo;s very hot, which usually takes a few minutes. Sear the steak on all sides with a knob of butter, for about one minute per side. Serve immediately.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If it&rsquo;s your first time reverse searing, you might be dismayed by how ugly and gray your steak looks out of the oven. Hang in there. Once you sear it, you&rsquo;ll understand what it&rsquo;s all about. Reverse seared steak has great flavor <em>and</em> looks beautiful. Although you miss out on some nice pan drippings, to me the benefits outweigh the missing fond. So say goodbye to scorching, and hello to a more relaxing, better steak experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've lived in Oregon for a decade, meaning I've experienced multiple wildfire seasons. You learn quickly, in these conditions, that staying on top of the air quality is essential: Prolonged exposure to poor air quality can have all kinds of negative affects on your health so you don't want to spend a lot of time outside if the air is bad.</p><p><a href="https://breathable.app/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Breathable</a> is a newly free app by the Portland-based app development agency <a href="https://karbon.agency/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Karbon</a> that adds an Air Quality Index (AQI) widget for your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Install the application, then add the widget to your device to be passively aware of the air quality every time you pick up your phone. (Yes, you could check the AQI in the Apple Weather app, but it doesn't offer an AQI widget.)</p><p>The application, while free, takes a little bit of work to set up. You'll need to get API keys from at least one service in order to use it. The good news is this process isn't long and <a href="https://breathable.app/help/keys/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">there's very clear documentation</a>. You'll need to head to <a href="http://IQAir.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">IQAir.com</a>, sign up for an account, choose the free plan, then copy the API key. You can repeat the process at <a href="http://Airnow.gov" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Airnow.gov</a> if you live in the United States and want access to information from the EPA. Then you'll need to specify, in the app's settings, which location you want to get AQI information for.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After setup, though, you just need to add the widgets wherever you like. Breathable offers two widgets, one small and one medium. You can add these widgets to your homescreen on an iPhone or iPad, as a complication on your Apple Watch, or on your Mac desktop. All of those options give you the AQI as a number and in a chart.</p><p>You can, optionally, customize the look of the widget with the font, gradient, and layout.

<p>You can also decide to show the AQI using an emoji scale instead of a number&mdash;some people find this easier to parse at a glance.

      <description>Watch Severance, and other Apple TV+ shows, without paying.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJYY6YZ1YVPXATDWNZ0R7V4/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the list of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-apple-tv-shows" target="_blank">Apple TV+'s great original shows</a>, <em>Severance</em> is among my favorites. In fact, Season 2 airs this Friday, Jan. 17, 2025. If you missed the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/watch-apple-tv-plus-originals-for-free-this-weekend" target="_blank">Apple TV+ free weekend</a> earlier this month, you can still sign up for a free trial to catch the show without committing to a subscription. </p><h2 id="get-the-7-day-trial">Get the 7-day trial</h2><p>This is the simplest method to get an Apple TV+ free trial, as you get it directly from the company. You can <a href="https://tv.apple.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">sign up for Apple TV+</a> on the company's website, and get a week-long free trial. After that, you'll pay $9.99 per month for the privilege of using the service.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="get-three-months-free-via-best-buy">Get three months free via Best Buy</h2><p>At the time of writing, Best Buy is offering one of the best free trials for Apple TV+, as the retailer will get you <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-free-apple-tv-for-3-months-new-or-qualified-returning-subscribers-only/6484512.p?intl=nosplash&amp;skuId=6484512" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">three months of Apple TV+ for free</a>. This offer is valid for new subscribers and "qualified returning subscribers." As long as you're not an active subscriber of Apple TV+, you should be able to use this offer in the US.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="buy-a-new-apple-device-for-a-free-apple-tv-trial">Buy a new Apple device for a free Apple TV+ trial</h2><p>Apple also offers a three-month free trial of Apple TV+, but to get it, you need to buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. The only limitation is that your device needs to be compatible with the latest version of its operating system. As long as it meets that criterion, you'll be able to claim the trial and enjoy all the content on the service without paying anything upfront.</p><h2 id="students-get-apple-tv-free-with-apple-music">Students get Apple TV+ free with Apple Music</h2><p>If you're a student, you can get an <a href="https://offers.applemusic.apple/student-offer" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Apple Music student subscription</a> for $5.99 per month. As an additional perk, this plan includes a free subscription to Apple TV+. You can stream the Severance soundtrack right after watching the show, in addition to anything else in the Apple Music library, of course.</p><h2 id="get-an-apple-one-free-trial-for-tv">Get an Apple One free trial for TV+</h2><p>For those who don't subscribe to Apple TV+, upgrading to an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Apple One subscription</a> is a way to score a one-month free trial. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/is-apple-one-worth-cost" target="_blank">Apple One</a> is the combined plan that includes iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade at plans starting at $19.95 per month. As long as the Apple One free trial is active, you can use Apple TV+ for free for a month.</p><h2 id="apple-tv-free-trial-via-a-playstation-5">Apple TV+ free trial via a PlayStation 5</h2><p>If you have a PlayStation 5, you can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/apple-tv-playstation-offers/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">claim a three-month Apple TV+ free trial</a>. This offer is valid till Jan. 27, 2025, and it's available to new and "qualified" returning subscribers.</p><h2 id="roku-owners-get-an-apple-tv-free-trial">Roku owners get an Apple TV+ free trial</h2><p>If you buy a new Roku device, you can also <a href="https://www.roku.com/deals/appletv" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">get a three-month free trial for Apple TV+</a>. Be sure to opt-in to receiving Roku emails in order to get the promo code. The offer is valid through Feb. 3, 2025, as noted on Roku's website at the time of writing.</p><h2 id="t-mobile-go5g-and-sprint-offer-apple-tv-free-trials">T-Mobile Go5G and Sprint offer Apple TV+ free trials</h2><p>T-Mobile's Go5G plans offer a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/tv-streaming/apple-tv-plus-deal" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">six-month Apple TV+ trial for free</a>. Similarly, some Sprint plans offer a six-month free Apple TV+ trial, while Sprint MAX customers can get a one-year free trial.</p><h2 id="watch-limited-apple-tv-shows-and-movies-for-free">Watch limited Apple TV+ shows and movies for free</h2><p>Apple TV+ also lets you watch some of its TV shows and movies for free, even if you aren't a subscriber. You can check out the catalog at <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/room/free-for-everyone/edt.item.5e826cea-061b-4e65-9ddb-703b51888d88" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Apple TV+'s Free for Everyone page</a>. These shows and movies are free for a limited time and you can expect the free catalog to change in the future. Unfortunately, Severance isn't among these options, which is why I listed this method at the end.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>10 Concrete Ways to Save More for Retirement in 2025</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHGTFHP1F7HEPYTN9Z97J7Z7</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Everyone wants to put more toward retirement. Here's how to actually do it.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHGTFHP1F7HEPYTN9Z97J7Z7/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter who you are, you're probably continuously plagued by the vague pressure to "save more." But making personal finance progress requires not just hopeful ambition, but identifying concrete steps to take. </p><p>Consider the actionable difference between a undefined intent to &ldquo;save more!&rdquo; and, say, telling yourself &ldquo;I am going to max out my Roth IRA this year,&rdquo; and you'll see why it's important to define your goals. And if you're looking for concrete steps, I've got you covered: Here are 10 steps you can take to actually increase your retirement savings this year.</p><h2 id="max-out-your-employer-sponsored-retirement-plans">Max out your employer-sponsored retirement plans</h2><p>For 2025 the IRS has increased the contribution limits for 401(k) plans to $23,500, up from $23,000 in 2024. Chances are good your employer offers some kind of 401(k) percentage match that can help you grow your savings. Even if you can't boost your savings all the way to $23,000 (ambitious!), if you're not already contributing enough to get your employer's full match, make this your first priority&mdash;it's essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings over the long term.</p><h2 id="leverage-catch-up-contributions">Leverage catch-up contributions</h2><p>If you're 50 or older, you're eligible for catch-up contributions in both your 401(k) and IRA accounts. These additional allowances can help you accelerate your savings during your peak earning years. In 2025, employees aged 60 to 63 will be able to make larger catch-up contributions to their <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/new-401k-withdrawal-rules" target="_blank"><u>401(k) plans</u></a>, with new limits set at either $10,000 annually or 150% of the standard catch-up contribution limit&mdash;whichever is greater.</p><h2 id="optimize-your-investment-strategy">Optimize your investment strategy</h2><p>Contributing is great, but you need to make sure your money is being invested in line with your goals, so consider <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/when-to-rebalance-your-investment-portfolio" target="_blank">reviewing and rebalancing your investment portfolio</a>. While maintaining a diversified approach, look into different investment vehicles that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This might include a mix of:</p><ul><li><p>Low-cost <a href="https://lifehacker.com/a-beginners-guide-to-index-funds-1840135748" target="_blank">index funds</a> for broad market exposure</p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/is-a-target-date-fund-the-best-choice" target="_blank">Target-date funds</a> that automatically adjust risk as you approach retirement</p></li><li><p>Individual stocks or bonds <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/when-to-hire-a-financial-advisor" target="_blank">if you have the expertise to manage them</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="automate-your-savings">Automate your savings</h2><p>The most important part of saving is consistency, so set up automatic contributions to your retirement accounts. This "pay yourself first" approach ensures consistent saving and helps avoid the temptation to spend money that should be set aside. I recommend spacing out your auto-contributions so your bank account doesn&rsquo;t take one big hit on the first of the month, every month.</p><p>Setting up auto-pay is simple to do online, and is usually just a matter of signing in to all of your accounts and finding the right menu. Once you do, it&rsquo;s time to get specific: Decide how much to contribute and when those payments should go out. Consider automatically increasing your contribution percentage each year, even by just 1%, to gradually build your savings without making too an significant impact on your monthly budget. </p><h2 id="max-out-your-health-savings-accounts-hsas">Max out your Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)</h2><p>If you have a high-deductible health plan, maximize contributions to your HSA. These accounts offer triple tax advantages: tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. After age 65, you can use HSA funds for non-medical expenses without penalty, making it an excellent additional retirement savings vehicle.</p><h2 id="take-advantage-of-tax-strategies">Take advantage of tax strategies</h2><p>Work with a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/should-you-hire-accountant" target="_blank">tax professional</a> to ensure you're taking advantage of all available tax benefits related to retirement savings. This might include:</p><ul><li><p>Traditional IRA deductions</p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/roth-ira-conversion" target="_blank">Strategic Roth conversions</a></p></li><li><p>Saver's credit, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-credit-savers-credit" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">if you qualify</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-is-tax-loss-harvesting-and-who-does-it-benefit-1849583091" target="_blank">Tax-loss harvesting</a> in taxable accounts</p></li></ul><p>I recommend getting ahead of the game right now by <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/ultimate-tax-spreadsheet-for-next-year-tax-season" target="_blank"><u>using a spreadsheet to track tax-related information</u></a> throughout the year.</p><h2 id="reduce-your-high-interest-debt-asap">Reduce your high-interest debt ASAP</h2><p>High-interest debt can severely impact your ability to save for retirement. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt#:~:text=The%20debt%20avalanche%20method&amp;text=You%20make%20minimum%20payments%20on%20every%20debt%20except%20the%20highest,least%20amount%20of%20interest%20charges." target="_blank">Develop a strategy</a> to pay down credit card balances and other high-interest loans. Once you've eliminated these financial drains, redirect those payment amounts to your retirement savings.</p><h2 id="create-a-clear-retirement-budget">Create a clear retirement budget</h2><p>Planning for retirement is about a lot more than just beefing up a retirement account. Develop a detailed retirement budget to understand exactly how much you <em>need</em> to save. This exercise can help you:</p><ul><li><p>Identify potential areas for increased savings</p></li><li><p>Set more precise savings goals</p></li><li><p>Make informed decisions about lifestyle adjustments</p></li><li><p>Plan for healthcare and long-term care costs</p></li></ul><p>Another thought is to consider additional income streams, with the sole goal of putting those earnings towards retirement. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-side-hustles-with-little-or-no-start-up-costs-1850467111" target="_blank">Here some of the most popular ways</a> to earn a little extra cash on the side.</p><h2 id="beef-up-your-emergency-fund">Beef up your emergency fund</h2><p>As always, you should <a href="https://lifehacker.com/heres-how-much-money-you-should-have-in-your-emergency-1850070761" target="_blank">maintain a robust emergency fund</a> <strong>separate</strong> from your retirement savings. This helps prevent the need to tap into retirement accounts for unexpected expenses, which can trigger taxes and penalties while derailing your long-term savings goals.</p><p>The typical rule of thumb is to aim for six months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. When you&rsquo;re figuring out that number, factor in expenses like housing, food, utilities, insurance, transportation, and debt payments. Non-essential expenses like vacations, entertainment, or dining out don&rsquo;t belong in your &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; calculations.</p><h2 id="schedule-regular-self-check-ins">Schedule regular self check-ins</h2><p>Schedule quarterly reviews of your retirement savings strategy. Monitor your progress, adjust contributions as needed, and stay informed about changes in retirement planning regulations and opportunities. This consistent attention helps ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals and can make necessary adjustments promptly.</p><p>Remember that successful retirement saving is a marathon, not a sprint. By chipping away at these strategies consistently and making adjustments as needed, you can take away some of the fear and uncertainty, and significantly improve your retirement readiness in 2025 and beyond.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's true, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4k42?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Meta%20Quest%203&amp;short_url=zj4k42&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Meta Quest 3</a> has better graphics, but it costs substantially more than the 3S version (currently $499.99). Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson got his VR headsets on to decide <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/which-is-better-meta-quest-3-vs-meta-quest-3s" target="_blank">which of the two is better</a>, with the Meta Quest 3S coming out victorious. You can see a more <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-quest-3s-review" target="_blank">in-depth review of the Quest 3S</a> here. There just isn't enough of a difference to justify the price difference, with the Quest 3S's graphics looking very close to the 3 and running the same games and apps.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S has a Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM, a display resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 (per eye), and a refresh rate of 120Hz. Once you put them on, the horizontal field of view is 96 degrees, and the vertical view is 90 degrees. The audio is stereo, which is nice, and the speakers are compatible with 3D spatial audio. When it comes to battery life, expect up to two and a half hours of juice before having to recharge (expect it to take about two hours for a full charge).</p><p>What makes the Meta Quest 3S special is how cheap it is to jump into the VR world, with other headsets going for much more (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXvX0?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Apple%27s%20Vision%20Pro&amp;short_url=aoXvX0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Apple's Vision Pro</a> is still $3,499).

      <title>Nintendo Music Is My Favorite App for Background Music</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JBHH4NBCZAXS1KTDG4GWTYD5</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>RIP, Nintendo channels on YouTube.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JBHH4NBCZAXS1KTDG4GWTYD5/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to listen to a soundtrack from a movie or TV show, you can usually find it on a licensed streaming service, if not buy the songs outright. Sadly, that's not typically the case with video-game music. Most game soundtracks are not publicly available, which is why YouTube is the #1 source for listening to tracks from your favorite games.</p><p>In particular, Nintendo <em>hates</em> when third parties upload any of their content to YouTube, whether that's game footage or music. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2022/05/31/nintendo-once-again-sent-500-copyright-blocks-to-remove-soundtrack-music-on-youtube/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Over the years</a>, the company has gone after creators who upload their copyrighted music to the platform, even though Nintendo itself has offered few viable outlets for fans to find that music legally. Until late last year, anyway.</p><h2 id="nintendo-music-is-the-answer">Nintendo Music is the answer</h2><p>At the end of October 2024, Nintendo announced a new music streaming service, called, appropriately, "<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/nintendo-music/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Nintendo Music</a>." Nintendo Music is an app for your smartphone, and it resembles other music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, only rather than find music from Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and The Beatles, it houses music from Mario, Zelda, and Metroid. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-DQ5EeImWYaI?si=fsS3Bc0hxogAysKi"></div>
</div>


<p>While you can find plenty of specific game soundtracks to listen to, there are some fun and unique options as well. Like other streaming services, Nintendo Music offers playlists based on different moods, themes, or even characters. There are playlists for songs inspired by Bowser or Peach, for example, as well as roundups of songs from boss battles, moments where you win the game, as well as when you start a new adventure. </p><p>The "Powering Up" playlist, for instance, has "Hyrule Field Main Theme" from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, "Mario Kart 8 Title Screen" from <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and "Tera Raid Battle" from <em>Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Pok&eacute;mon Violet</em>. Not bad.</p><h2 id="how-nintendo-music-works">How Nintendo Music works</h2><p>The app is free to download on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Android</a>, but you do need to be subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online. (Any of the plans will do.) After downloading the app, I just needed to sign into my account, choose whether or not to enable notification (never enable notifications), tap through a pop-up warning me that some songs may be spoilers for games I haven't beaten yet, and I was in.</p><p>As far as streaming apps go, it's pretty straightforward: You choose a song or playlist, and it plays, complete with a still from its game. One neat feature is you can tap an "Extend to" button on certain songs to have a song play for 15, 30, or even 60 minutes. (But when are you going to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNwKYgM6SkM" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a 10-hour option</a>, Nintendo?) You have basic playback controls, the option to repeat or shuffle, and the option to reorder a playlist.</p><p>If you tap the (&bull;&bull;&bull;) menu on any given song, you can choose to add it to your favorites, download the song for offline playback, add the song to another playlist, add the song next on your queue, add the song last on your queue, see more tracks from the game the song is from, share the song with others, or see the credits for the track itself.</p><h2 id="a-growing-library-with-some-oversights">A growing library (with some oversights)</h2><p>As a huge fan of Nintendo music, the music, I'm mostly feeling positive about Nintendo Music, the app. This experience is long overdue, and the selection of tracks is relatively varied, especially now that it has been up and running for a few months. There are songs from many different Nintendo brands and eras, including new <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em>, old <em>Donkey Kong</em>, even <em>Nintendogs</em>. </p><p>This isn't something Nintendo launched and immediately abandoned, either: The company has been adding new game soundtracks each month since the app's release:</p><ul><li><p>In October, right after debuting the service, Nintendo added music from <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. </p></li><li><p>In November, we got <em>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</em>, <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>F-Zero X</em>, and <em>Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! </em></p></li><li><p>In December, Nintendo added <em>Splatoon 2</em>, <em>Wave Race 64</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em>, a "Party" playlist, and <em>Super Mario 64</em>. </p></li><li><p>In January, we have <em>Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>.</p></li></ul><p>I still have a soft spot for those YouTube playlists I used to rely on for background music. Those creators didn't own the rights to the tracks, but they spent time crafting playlists of their favorite Nintendo tunes for others to enjoy, in a time when they largely did not exist outside the games they came from. </p><p>While many of those creators' efforts may be more in jeopardy than ever, Nintendo Music has not replaced one particularly important subgenre on YouTube: Nintendo lofi. While you can listen to many Nintendo originals on the company's new app, you can still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVKYPXwdYUQfgA05CkyFSg" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">turn to creators like GameChops</a> for lofi remixes of iconic tracks. (I'm quite partial to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdzrrWA8e7A" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Zelda &amp; Chill</a>" playlists, but "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5V-qL1HRho" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Chilltendo Deluxe</a>" offers a good mix of different Nintendo tunes as lofi beats.)</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-c5V-qL1HRho"></div>
</div>


<p>One interesting benefit to using the official app is that Nintendo is taking spoilers <em>seriously</em>. If you're worried about seeing song titles that may ruin plot points to games you haven't played or finished, you can go into Settings, hit "Spoiler prevention," and add all the games you want to hide music from.</p><h2 id="another-unexpected-move-from-nintendo">Another unexpected move from Nintendo</h2><p>Why is Nintendo launching this app at this late date? The company has been acting a little odd lately. While <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-roundup" target="_blank">rumors swirl about the successor to the Nintendo Switch</a> (lovingly referred to as the Nintendo Switch 2), the company has decidedly not made any significant announcements about it. Instead, they've dropped goodies like Nintendo Music, and an unrelated piece of hardware: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-switch-2-nintendo-just-released-a-100-interactive-alarm-clock-called-alarmo" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a $100 alarm clock called Alarmo</a>. </p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 news does seem to be immanent, but until that new console comes along, at least we can enjoy waking up and going through our days to the beat of Nintendo music.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seven of My Favorite YouTube Cleaning Influencers</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">01JHK034TFMKFQ3206CX4RJVX4</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>YouTube is full of cleaning and organizing inspiration. Here are my top picks.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHK034TFMKFQ3206CX4RJVX4/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I was working on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/best-cleaning-accounts-instagram" target="_blank">a post about the best cleaning influencers to follow on Instagram</a> in the wake of the news that TikTok is going to become unavailable in the U.S. at the end of this week, I noticed something: Some of the most popular creators in the space aren't making mini videos on Reels; instead, they're operating over on YouTube, where they have more options for presenting their tips and inspiration. Here are some of the best ones you can follow now. </p><h2 id="midwest-magic-cleaning">Midwest Magic Cleaning</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-q1COnGU8p0U"></div>
</div>


<p>I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MidwestMagicCleaning" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Midwest Magic Cleaning</a> videos because they're completely attainable. You're not watching someone in a palatial home use the most expensive vacuum on the market, but rather a down-to-earth guy who takes turns being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61n6zWQ71CY" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">inspirational</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1COnGU8p0U" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">relatable</a> while teaching you cleaning basics and doing a little home reno. Also&mdash;and this is important&mdash;the videos are funny. </p><h2 id="aurikatariina">Aurikatariina</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-SM1qOorn3O0"></div>
</div>


<p>You've probably seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aurikatariina" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Aurikatariina's</a> videos crossposted on Facebook or X, but she's worth a follow on her own because she cleans other people's homes for free. While your house may not be at the level of disrepair the ones she deals with are, you can pick up a lot of great tips from her. She cleans with a positive attitude and a lot of empathy, which I find inspiring when I watch her joyfully clear away trash and share her preferred products. When she uses a product, she even puts a little graphic of exactly what it looks like in its packaging on screen, so you know precisely what to buy for similar results. </p><h2 id="this-crazy-life">This Crazy Life</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-UTfOf71dVWI"></div>
</div>


<p>Another channel full of relatable content is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThisCrazyLife" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">This Crazy Life</a>, where the creator, Amanda, gives a realistic look at how she cleans the home she shares with her family, including three young sons. She offers a variety of content types, from testing out "viral hacks" to showcasing how she refreshes different rooms around her house on a budget. Personally, I'm tired of unrelatable influencers (at least in the cleaning space) and enjoy seeing how real people with normal lives and jobs navigate staying organized on top of their other responsibilities, so these videos are great. </p><h2 id="clean-my-space">Clean My Space</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-tH-5qjyzxOs"></div>
</div>


<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cleanmyspace" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Clean My Space</a>, you can find the answer to any cleaning question. Seriously, this channel has it all. Where other cleaning channels focus on the satisfying clips of creators wiping down grimy sinks or transforming rooms, this one functions kind of like a how-to guide, with dedicated videos for everything from cleaning a glass stove to making your own cleaning solutions. </p><h2 id="the-best-organizing-channels-on-youtube">The best organizing channels on YouTube</h2><p>I also love watching videos of people organizing, not just cleaning, their homes; for me, that's where real inspiration comes in. It's satisfying to see someone wipe away some grime, but in most cases, I already know how to do that. Seeing how someone organizes their stuff, however, can give me all kinds of new ideas. </p><h3>iOrganize</h3><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-ivmgbdm5Smk"></div>
</div>


<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@iOrganizeEverything" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">iOrganize</a> is my favorite organizer on the internet&mdash;not really a category of influencer I ever thought I'd have a "favorite" of before I started writing about cleaning and organizing, but here we are. On the channel, Christen Fackler offers direct, no-nonsense advise on how to rethink the way you organize your home. The clips are filmed simply and all the focus is on the tips, which is refreshing and gets straight to the point. </p><h3>The Carla Project</h3><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-I6QPB1ecEUQ"></div>
</div>


<p>Another genre I enjoy involves one organizer going into other people's homes and teaching them how to declutter and organize. That's what happens over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCarlaProject" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The Carla Project</a>, where you get to see a bunch of different living spaces and can find clips that align with your exact needs, from "small kitchens" to "crowded closets." The creator, Carla, also shows how she's getting on in her own personal organizing and decorating projects. </p><h3>The Secret Slob</h3><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-IvxaQVnL9Xg"></div>
</div>


<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/thesecretslob" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The Secret Slob</a> uses and demonstrates the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-flylady-cleaning-method" target="_blank">FlyLady cleaning method</a>, so you know she knows what she's talking about, since that's one of the best organizing techniques out there. Steph, the creator, gives gentle guidance on how to get started with a cleaning technique, how to prioritize peace through cleaning, and how to stick with a habit. She shares before-and-afters as well as lessons she's learned while working through the FlyLady system, all in a way that feels accessible. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J4J0FNB84FM447H4ZE3C8W18/hero-image.jpg"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a little game I like to play sometimes, and it seems to be popular with other folks who tend to work out at home: What equipment would I buy if I were starting a new home gym from scratch? Or you can play the advanced version: If you already have (insert common items here), what would you buy next?</p><p>What follow are my picks for anybody starting a new home gym or looking to expand the one they have&mdash;whether that means a corner of your bedroom or a full-on garage-based weightlifting paradise. I'll start with space- and budget-friendly items, then move on to some bigger-ticket buys. </p><h2 id="kettlebells">Kettlebells </h2><p>If I had to put together a home gym from scratch, I think I would start with two kettlebells: one light enough to strict press or snatch, and one <a href="https://lifehacker.com/for-fucks-sake-please-stop-swinging-light-kettlebells-1850344356" target="_blank">heavy enough to make swings and goblet squats challenging</a>. For a beginner, that might be a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV7bY3?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=25%20pound%20kettlebell&amp;short_url=QV7bY3&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">25 pound kettlebell</a> and a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXbeq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=50%20pound%20kettlebell&amp;short_url=QqXbeq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">50 pound kettlebell</a>; if you're stronger, obviously go heavier. The basic cast iron type is usually cheapest, while the colorful <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjXq2?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=competition%20style%20kettlebells&amp;short_url=zEjXq2&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">competition style kettlebells</a> feel a bit nicer. </p><p>If I had a smidge of extra cash, I&rsquo;d buy them as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-your-home-gym-needs-adjustable-kettlebells-1848784354" target="_blank"><em>adjustable</em> kettlebells</a>, like <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdZOx?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=this%20one%20from%20Bells%20of%20Steel&amp;short_url=GdZOx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">this one from Bells of Steel</a>, so they could get heavier as I got stronger. Competition-style adjustables are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-your-home-gym-needs-adjustable-kettlebells-1848784354" target="_blank">by far the best kind</a>, since they keep the same, smooth shape no matter what weight you load them to. This lets you do cleans, presses, and snatches, rather than limiting you to swings. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<h2 id="a-rowing-machine">A rowing machine</h2><p>My first choice for a cardio machine is the bike, as mentioned earlier. But if you want another device, I&rsquo;d vote for a rower.

<h2 id="dumbbells">Dumbbells</h2><p>Dumbbells are a great way to lift weights at home. They&rsquo;re smaller than a barbell, less specialized than a set of kettlebells, and you can do a ton of different workouts with them. </p><p>As with kettlebells, you&rsquo;ll need to decide if you want to get a few pairs at specific fixed weights (cheaper to start), or go for a pricier adjustable set. Rubber hex dumbbells are the best bet if you want a selection of dumbbells you can just grab and use without adjusting.

<h2 id="resistance-bands">Resistance bands</h2><p>Throw a band on your pullup bar and you have a way to do assisted pullups; hold a band in your hands instead and you can do band pull-aparts. Bands are also a great addition to your barbells if you don&rsquo;t have quite enough plates (or if you&rsquo;re a fan of conjugate training, in which case you&rsquo;re probably already putting bands and chains on everything that isn&rsquo;t nailed down.) If you want to use bands with barbells, look for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/qkyE6?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=long%20loop%20type&amp;short_url=qkyE6&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">long loop type</a>; if you want to use them on their own, look for <a href="https://zdcs.link/knyE5?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=the%20kind%20that%20clip%20to%20handles&amp;short_url=knyE5&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the kind that clip to handles</a>. </p><h2 id="sandbags">Sandbags</h2><p>Sandbags are the under-appreciated workhorses of many a home gym. Sand is dirt cheap&mdash;almost literally&mdash;but expect to pay a few bucks for a really <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0yKr?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=quality%20fabric%20sandbag&amp;short_url=Y0yKr&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">quality fabric sandbag</a> to put it in. (That said, you <em>can</em> DIY this, <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/how-to-build-the-best-weightlifting-sandbag-1830076035" target="">and we have instructions</a>.) Start with a bag that weighs maybe half as much as you do, and practice picking it up, carrying it, and generally doing anything people do with weights. Yes, you can even press it overhead if you&rsquo;re careful. If that&rsquo;s all too easy, go for a bag that weighs as much as you do, or more.</p><h2 id="a-plyo-box">A plyo box</h2><p>A box is a handy thing to have around, and one of the few things I&rsquo;ve always wanted in my home gym but never found the space for. With <a href="https://zdcs.link/JdDeq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=one%20box&amp;short_url=JdDeq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">one box</a>, you can do box jumps or box squats. With two, you can do dips or stand on top of them and set up a belt squat. The possibilities are endless.</p><h2 id="specialty-bars">Specialty bars</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re shopping for the person who has everything, I&rsquo;ll tell you what they don&rsquo;t have: another specialty bar. After a normal barbell, a typical next purchase is a <a href="https://zdcs.link/PyveA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=safety%20squat%20bar&amp;short_url=PyveA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">safety squat bar</a>.

A dedicated deadlift bar is perfect for the deadlift specialist in your life, and a football bar or Swiss bar gives you lots of options for pressing.

<p>Amazon says it tested the function, battery, and software of all of these refurbished products; it comes with the same one-year limited warranty as a new device. </p><p>The Kindle Scribe first came out in 2022; that first version is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wX2Dq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=currently%20%24339.99&amp;short_url=9wX2Dq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">currently $339.99</a>. If you already have the 2022 version, there really is no reason to upgrade. The main difference is the 2024 version  comes with the Premium Pen instead of the Basic Pen stylus. The tablet itself is shorter, narrower, and slimmer, but not by much (you can even still use the same case). The new screen also has texture, which will add more resistance when you're writing on it, and the gap between the screen and the outer casing is smaller. But that's where the differences end, at least according to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-kindle-scribe-2024" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag's 3.5-star review</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, you'll get the same 16GB or 32GB of storage, the same book format compatibility, the same 15.3 oz weight, the same glare-free 300 ppi front-lit display screen, and the same 12-week battery life. Both tablets run the same software. Still, if you don't own a Scribe at all and are considering getting one, the newer version is the better option, especially at this price.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>These fine films are definitely DTF.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>The people  in them may be pretty, sure, but cinematic sex scenes of today are often downright sterile. Even in the conservative 1980s, mainstream movies were happy to explore adult sexuality, while the modern four-quadrant blockbuster world leaves us dry (so to speak) for fear of excluding any youngster who might be in the audience. </p><p>Even the superhero movie couples of ages past&mdash;Superman (Christopher Reeve) and Lois (Margot Kidder), or Batman (Michael Keaton) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer)&mdash;generated real heat compared to our modern, Disney-fied view of cinematic romance. While there have been some promising developments on this front over the past year (<em>Challengers,</em> <em>Babygirl</em>), on the whole, movies just don't seem as horny as they used to.</p><p>So let's celebrate all the films that are just <em>aching for it. </em>Movies in which every scene seems fueled by pent-up desire, roiling with need, drenched in straight-up horniness. Echoing real life, these movies are positively lousy with people who desperately want to fuck. None of the horniest movies qualify as porn&mdash;some don&rsquo;t even have any traditional sex scenes&mdash;but every one of them is DTF from the first frame to the end credits.</p><hr><h2 id="poor-things-2023"><em>Poor Things</em> (2023)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>What if <em>Frankenstein</em>, but sexy? Yorgos Lanthimos adapts the 1992 Alasdair Gray novel with Emma Stone in the lead role as a reanimated corpse with the mind of a child, gradually discovering the Victorian world around her. Simple-minded at first, she appears monstrous before discovering something like free will which leads, perhaps inevitably, to the joys of masturbation. She becomes hungry&mdash;ravenous, even&mdash;to experience the world, and lacks the inhibitions imposed on other women of her era. And, honestly: get it. <strong>You can stream <em>Poor Things</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXAlA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=9wXAlA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hulu</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXb0G?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=znXb0G&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Though it&rsquo;s an element largely absent from the source material, cinema&rsquo;s reigning prince of darkness has been depicted as one horny motherfucker since at least 1931, when Bela Lugosi brought an eastern European regality and seductiveness to the role. The Hammer Horror updates of the 1960s introduced an even more overtly charming Dracula, and the vampires-equal-sexy ethos has since spread out to encompass the entire vampire genre, from <em>Interview With the Vampire</em> to <em>Twilight </em>(two exceptionally horny films we&rsquo;ll discuss later). <br><br>The lurid Francis Ford Coppola take, though, is something else entirely, particularly in the film&rsquo;s first half: Dracula&rsquo;s sumptuous (if rotting) castle is dressed for Roman-style orgies, full of bare-chested, man-hungry brides; Keanu Reeves wanders its halls in a psychedelic haze, and with an obvious, all-but-visible movie-length boner. Things don&rsquo;t let up much once the actions shifts to London, and a now more-human-looking Gary Oldman begins his pursuit of Winona Ryder&rsquo;s Mina, who is <em>significantly</em> younger than he is. Every frame drips red with desire. <strong>You can rent <em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXKxw?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QpXKxw&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Sex, power, and insecurity are all knotted up together in this Oscar-winning dark comedy involving a love triangle between a mercurial Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) and two women (Emma Stone and Rechel Weisz) who are perfectly happy to make use of the queen&rsquo;s need for emotional and sexual validation as a ladder as they move their way up in the court of the British monarchy. <strong>You can rent <em>The Favourite </em>from <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RjNP?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z3RjNP&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps play next-door neighbors who, over the course of several years, struggle with their growing attraction to each other, even while their career goals (their each pursuing careers in professional basketball) pull them apart.

<p>After Prime adapted the bestselling gay romance<em> Red, White, and Royal Blue</em> (to which we'll return), the streamer called up one of that movie's stars, Nicholas Galitzine, for a take on Robinne Lee's bestseller about a divorced art gallery owner (played by Anne Hathaway) turning 40 who begins an affair with the member of a boy band (he's in his mid-twenties, so it's not that icky). It's essentially a rom-com, but the leads generate genuine horny tension, while the age gap adds enough scandal to make it all feel a bit naughty. <strong>You can stream <em>The Idea of You</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ2X1g?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=zJ2X1g&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Given the title and the topic at hand, you might think this is a BDSM drama from&mdash;instead, it's a poignant (but still hot) romantic drama following Ronit, a woman (Rachel Weisz) who returns to the heart of her Orthodox Jewish community in North London for the funeral of her father. She'd previously been banished in part due to her romantic relationship with Esti (Rachel McAdams) when she was younger. Esti is still there, and that the old passion between the two is quickly reignited, even in the face of a great deal of disapproval. <strong>You can stream <em>Disobedience</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXmOj?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=QxXmOj&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RyYV?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z3RyYV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Ostensibly it's the story of an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts), new to Los Angeles, who finds her life entangled with that of a woman with amnesia (Laura Harring) recovering from a car accident. Though things ultimately take a dark and surrealist turn (we're in a David Lynch movie, after all), the sexual and romantic chemistry between the two is searing, and even more impressive given the minimal mainstream representations of queerness circa 2001. <strong>You can stream <em>Mulholland Drive</em> on The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOR3qO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QOR3qO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver Quick, a scholarship kid at Oxford who immediately sets out to ingratiate himself with rich golden boy Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). In fact, the clever Oliver will do just about anything to further his aims but, with shades of Tom Ripley, he wants to be inside Felix nearly as much as he wants to be in his world. Oliver goes quite a bit further than Ripley, though, including by getting up close and very personal with the remains of Felix's bath water. <strong>You can stream <em>Saltburn</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjXXJ?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=zEjXXJ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

The two leads (Geoffrey Cou&euml;t and Fran&ccedil;ois Nambot) circle each other, for a time, before their mutual attraction breaks through the tangle of sweaty bodies and they connect over more than just fucking (but also, fucking). The film follows them over the next hour or so, exploring how much, and how little, two men can connect over the course of a couple of hours. <strong>You can stream <em>Paris 05:59</em> on <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/548907/paris-05-59-th-o-hugo" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Tubi</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<hr><h2 id="def-by-temptation-1990"><em>Def by Temptation</em> (1990)</h2><p>It's bad news when K (Kadeem Hardison) meets a seductive woman (Cynthia Bond) at a bar&mdash;because she's a literal succubus, luring in men who disrespect women and killing them, or at least maneuvering them into being killed. K begs off, but he's visited by his friend Joel (the movie's writer and director, James Bond III, no relation), a minister who's become increasingly disenchanted with his faith and is very open to the idea of making time with Temptress. <strong>You can stream <em>Def by Temptation</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6oKKd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z6oKKd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>, Tubi, Shudder, AMC+, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6oKKd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Freevee&amp;short_url=z6oKKd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Freevee</a></strong><strong>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR3GG1?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Peacock&amp;short_url=aR3GG1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Peacock</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>New Queer Cinema auteur Gregg Araki referred to this as his "heterosexual" movie, but that only works in the sense that it centers a cis male-female couple (James Duval and Rose McGowan) at the outset. Their dynamic is quickly upended by the arrival of a drifter the call X (Johnathon Schaech). Though jealousy and clashing personalities complicate matters, the three have sex in a variety of configurations as they travel a blasted Los Angeles, becoming involved in increasingly (and intentionally) absurd violent incidents. <strong>You can stream <em>The Doom Generation</em> on The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBpqJJ?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aBpqJJ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The stunningly sensuous and deeply disturbing film tells a fictionalized version of the story of Sada Abe, who murdered her lover in a scandalous case from the 1930s. Accounts paint her as either a monster, or a proto-feminist heroine (of sorts), depending on who is telling the story. She's played here by Eiko Matsuda, a former sex worker now making a living as a maid in the hotel where she begins an intense affair with the married owner, Kichiz&#333; Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji). The passion between them grows in intensity until it becomes mutual obsession, and the sexually explicit film draws us in to their doomed affair. <strong>You can stream <em>In the Realm of the Senses</em> on <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/in-the-realm-of-the-senses" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The Criterion Channel</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The two are never in bed together, but the slow-burn passion between Daniel Day-Lewis&rsquo; fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (cough) and Vicky Krieps as his muse makes this Paul Thomas Anderson&rsquo;s sexiest movie, even more so than his porno epic <em>Boogie Nights</em>. Woodcock&rsquo;s fastidious and obsessive attention to detail in his interactions with Keieps&rsquo; Alma build an atmosphere of tamped-down lust that only grows as the film progresses.<strong> You can stream <em>The Phantom Thread</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80195447" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGD3x?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QGGD3x&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>There&rsquo;s some actual sex in Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n&rsquo;s coming-of-age masterpiece, but it&rsquo;s really a movie about adolescent yearning: between two teenage boys, and between them and the slightly older (and married) woman with whom they set out on an impromptu road trip. Their more typical teenage horniness (and repressed longing) is complicated by the presence of a more mature sexuality, and a medical condition that might make this her last fling. <strong>You can stream <em>Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/60023237" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOR4ln?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=QOR4ln&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hulu</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Roger Ebert astutely described <em>The Last Picture Show</em> as being about &ldquo;...a town with no reason to exist, and people with no reason to live there.&rdquo; Aside from the pool hall and the titular movie theater, there&rsquo;s nothing to <em>do</em> there but have sex (which also happens in the pool hall and the movie theater). The teenagers are horny, naturally, but so are the adults&mdash;particularly Cloris Leachman&rsquo;s bored and neglected housewife, Ruth Popper, who begins an affair with high school senior Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) that&rsquo;s partly torrid, and partly rote. <strong>You can rent<em> The Last Picture Show</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YGDO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=a5YGDO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The first of many cinematic adaptations of Patricia Highsmith&rsquo;s Tom Ripley novels, and one of the best. Alain Delon brings Ripley to life in all his sociopathic glory. Though the love triangle between the three main characters doesn&rsquo;t play out quite as explicitly here as it does in later adaptations, the film deals with mutual obsession in the glistening Mediterranean. <strong>You can stream <em>Purple Noon</em> on The Criterion Channel or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6o7dY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z6o7dY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Speaking of, the 1999 adaptation of the eponymous Highsmith novel comes a hair closer than <em>Purple Noon</em> to capturing Tom Ripley&rsquo;s guiltless amorality (he&rsquo;s more fun in the books than in any of the films, honestly), but goes much further in bringing the subtext of Tom&rsquo;s obsession with Dickie Greenleaf to the surface, capturing the extreme and conflicted feeling of wanting to sleep with someone and wanting to<em> be</em> <em>them</em> at the same time. <strong>You can stream <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM6lZL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Paramount%2B&amp;short_url=aM6lZL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Paramount+</a></strong><strong> or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41xlA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=Q41xlA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Guillermo del Toro&rsquo;s stylized, under-appreciated gothic romance stars Mia Wasikowska as a young woman in a highly ill-conceived marriage to Tom Hiddleston who finds herself drawn to Charlie Hunnam (sure), even as Hiddleston&rsquo;s character seemed too distracted by his sister (Jessica Chastain) to notice. The upper-crust Edwardian costumes and settings all contribute to the air of repressed longing. Plus, there&rsquo;s the incest. <strong>You can rent<em> Crimson Peak</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR3bR8?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aR3bR8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>There&rsquo;s an unnerving sexual chemistry between Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe on display in this nightmarish throwback to silent-era filmmaking, but, in fairness, they&rsquo;re cold and very lonely.

<p>In opulent 18th-century France, Marianne is assigned to paint a portrait of aristocrat H&eacute;lo&iuml;se. The resulting image will be used to advertise H&eacute;lo&iuml;se to a potential suitor in far-off Milan. The forbidden (for several reasons) romance that develops between them is as steamy as it is necessarily short-lived. <strong>You can stream <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqX3o6?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=QqX3o6&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hulu</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A better-than-decent sex farce and buddy comedy, <em>Booty Call</em> sees Jamie Foxx and Tommy Davidson on a particularly promising double-date with Vivica A.

The two men go on a hunt for those essentials before their dates get bored and give up. <strong>You can stream <em>Booty Call</em> on Tubi or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4bOB?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aN4bOB&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Jealousy and passion are all over Jean Vigo&rsquo;s story of newlyweds on a boat. Husband Jean quickly becomes jealous of his new wife Juliette, who understandably has interests that go beyond hanging out on a canal barge all the time.

<p>The chemistry here between Michael Keaton and Michelle Pfeiffer is intense (particularly in the ballroom scene), and all the more so for being the last gasp in superhero-movie sexuality (good luck finding anything even <em>remotely</em> horny about the MCU). But Pfeiffer&rsquo;s Catwoman is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here, so much so that the character represented a sexual awakening for both straight and queer kids of the &lsquo;90s. <strong>You can rent <em>Batman Returns</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM6l2m?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aM6l2m&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>The only movie in the series with a male lead, the <em>Nightmare</em> sequel plays out as Freddy&rsquo;s seduction of Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), all while Jesse is dodging his girlfriend in favor of his best friend, Ron.

<p>Long banned for its homosexual content, the two men at the heart of Jean Genet&rsquo;s <em>A Song of Love</em> never share a room, except in a brief, chaste, fantasy sequence. Two prisoners in adjacent cells share a palpable passion for each other, violently discouraged by a guard. The short film&rsquo;s key moment involves a bit of cigarette smoke shared through a straw, one of cinema&rsquo;s most surprisingly erotic sequences. <strong>You can stream <em>Un Chant D&rsquo;Amour</em> (aka <em>Song of Love</em>) on <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/song-love" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Kanopy</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>It was the slowest of slow burns for Jesse and C&eacute;line (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy), but here the tension is off-the-charts: they haven&rsquo;t seen each other in years, and neither was expecting their fierce attraction to reignite so quickly. He&rsquo;s married and she&rsquo;s in a relationship, but, by the end, none of it matters. <strong>You can rent <em>Before Sunset </em>from <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ2nGD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=zJ2nGD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A coming-of-age story involving young, mercurial Elio (Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet) and older Oliver (Armie Hammer),&nbsp;<em>Call Me By Your Name</em>&nbsp;takes place mostly during one sweaty, sun-baked summer in northern Italy. For Elio, it's a time of increasing sexual frustration&mdash;to the point that he sneaks off to smell Oliver's clothes. Sex with childhood friend Marzia doesn't quite scratch the itch and, before long, Elio and Oliver are engaged in a clandestine affair&mdash;and partaking of the local produce. <strong>You can stream <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Rj7R?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=z3Rj7R&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Max</a></strong><strong> or rent it from<a href="https://zdcs.link/QKO2ry?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QKO2ry&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"> Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>This was a gateway movie for an entire generation of budding your hornballs for more than one sexual orientation. Reorienting the 18th century novel <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em> to a 1990s prep school, the film deals with sex, desirability, and power, while also serving as a reminder that the idle rich are never to be trusted. Everyone here is looking for sex, and <em>almost </em>everyone here is using their sexuality as a means to an end. One of the key scenes, and one of the film's best, involves Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) teaches Cecile (Selma Blair) how to french kiss. <strong>You can rent <em>Cruel Intentions</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Rj8P?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=z3Rj8P&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>From the Casey McQuiston bestseller, <em>Red, White, and Royal Blue</em> finds the spare heir (or is it heir spare?) to the British throne falling out with the son of the President of the United States&mdash;a minor diplomatic problem that the two are strongly encouraged to rectify. Of course, in the process of pretending not to hate each other, the two come to <em>really</em> not hate each other. So much so that they're sneaking off whenever they get the chance. The premise is rom-com to the hilt, but the leads (Taylor Zakhar Perez, Nicholas Galitzine) generate real sparks. <strong>You can stream <em>Red, White, and Royal Blue</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGDAx?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QGGDAx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Josh O&rsquo;Connor (<em>The Crown</em>&rsquo;s Prince Charles) and Alec Sec&#259;reanu play Yorkshire farmer Johnny and Romanian migrant worker Gheorghe. Johnny's largely content to bang any man who'll give him the time of day in the remote village, at least until he's joined by Gheorghe.

<p>Thoroughly sexually explicit, and also an incredibly effective thriller (it made a bunch of top 10 lists in its year), writer/director Alain Guiraudie's drama takes place in and around a gay cruising spot at a nude beach and the nearby woods. Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps) falls in lust, and maybe love, with Michel (Christophe Paou)&mdash;who he later observes drowning another man in the lake. Franck isn't sure he's willing to let that stop him from getting what is <em>clearly</em>some excellent, if dangerous, D. <strong>You can rent <em>Stranger by the Lake</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/916KmR?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=916KmR&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Halle Berry won an Academy Award for her performance as Leticia Musgrove, wife of a convicted murderer whose death has been overseen by Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), the deputy warden. They're both deeply damaged and broken people, lashing out at everyone around them in ways that are frequently abusive. They also develop an intense, and passionate, connection that can't fix either of them, but that can cut through all the people and things telling them to stay apart. <strong>You can rent <em>Monster's Ball</em> from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9243Zy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9243Zy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Spike Lee's first feature film follows the instantly iconic Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) juggling three very different men, and finding that only together do they have all the qualities she's looking for. The movie's legacy is complicated by a rape scene that's handled pretty atrociously (<a href="https://deadline.com/2014/05/no-cannes-do-why-spike-lee-nixed-do-the-right-thing-silver-anni-for-black-fest-fete-729355/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Spike Lee agrees</u></strong></a>), but the movie nonetheless takes seriously the idea that (*gasp*) a woman might have sexual needs and wants that deserve to be taken seriously. <strong>You can stream <em>She's Gotta Have It</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/60034929" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

      <title>Are '2x Concentrated' Cleaners Worth Your Money?</title>

      <description>I've used Science to determine if your cleaning products need upgrading.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Growing up, my mom used Pine Sol to clean everything around our home and taught me to do the same. When I moved to New York at 18, I learned that my new Queens- and Manhattan-born friends were all about Fabuloso. I used the two products faithfully throughout my adult life and was perfectly satisfied with how well they worked. When I noticed a few months ago that both brands&mdash;as well as others I trusted, like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4kbr?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Mr.%20Clean&amp;short_url=zj4kbr&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Mr. Clean</a>&mdash;were rolling out new "2x concentrated" formulas, I wasn't sure what to think. If something isn't broken, I don't seek to fix it, you know? I took note of price differences and wondered if it was, perhaps, a gimmick. (In addition to teaching me about the wonders of Pine Sol, my mom also taught me to be deeply distrustful of marketing.) The price of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7E36V?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=80%20ounces%20of%20double-concentrated%20Pine%20Sol&amp;short_url=z7E36V&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">80 ounces of double-concentrated Pine Sol</a> is between $15 and $20, depending on various discounts, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/924yXM?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=96%20ounces%20of%20regular%20Pine%20Sol&amp;short_url=924yXM&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">96 ounces of regular Pine Sol</a> comes in at $18.49. Broken down, the more concentrated version was spendier by a tad&mdash;but was it worth it? </p><p>After using the new Pine Sol formulation for a few months, I can say that yes, it is worth it&mdash;but to be on the safe side, I conducted what I consider a very scientific experiment today with my standard Fabuloso and its double-concentrated counterpart. </p><h2 id="the-fabuloso-experiment">The Fabuloso experiment</h2><p>This week, Fabuloso sent me their newest scent to test out. I was excited about this because I love things that smell like peaches, but didn't realize I'd signed up for a 2x concentrated version. When I opened it, I was even more excited because I already had a full bottle of regular Fabuloso on hand, which meant I could do a true comparison. The first part of that comparison is price: The <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXmRO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=56-ounce%20bottle%20of%202x-concentrated%20Fabuloso&amp;short_url=QxXmRO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">56-ounce bottle of 2x-concentrated Fabuloso</a> is $5.49 and 48 ounces of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXmrq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=the%20regular%20stuff&amp;short_url=9wXmrq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the regular stuff</a> will run you $4.59. That's 10 cents per ounce either way, though I know these prices vary. What you pay at your local corner store is different than what you pay at Walmart and that's to say nothing about the fluctuating prices and sales on Amazon. I even found <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0nbxe?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=a%2056-ounce%20bottle%20of%202x-concentrated%20Fabuloso&amp;short_url=a0nbxe&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">a 56-ounce bottle of 2x-concentrated Fabuloso</a> for 10 cents <em>cheaper</em> than the standard formula at Target. Generally speaking, you're looking at spending around $5, give or take, no matter which formula you choose. </p><p>Now, for the cleaning power. First, I spent some time this morning looking around my home to find the dirtiest spot. I unearthed a baseboard that had been hidden by a shelf for a long time. It was <em>disgusting</em>. Perfect! </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-1.fill.size_2000x1343.v1736870871.png" alt="Very dirty baseboard" width="2000" height="1343" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-1.fill.size_800x537.v1736870871.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-1.fill.size_1400x940.v1736870871.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-1.fill.size_2000x1343.v1736870871.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Terrible!</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Then, I set about figuring out how to compare these two products in the most responsible, scientific way. I settled on splitting the baseboard in half and using the same exact amount of each formula to scrub one side or the other. I used one capful as my amount and split a paper towel down the middle so each capful would be distributed evenly across the same amount of towel. This is how science gets done. Here is the left half of the baseboard, cleaned with normal Fabuloso:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-2.fill.size_2000x1426.v1736870871.png" alt="Half clean baseboard" width="2000" height="1426" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-2.fill.size_800x571.v1736870871.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-2.fill.size_1400x998.v1736870871.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-2.fill.size_2000x1426.v1736870871.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Decent!</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>And here is how the section looked when I used the 2x-concentrated formula to clean the other half:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-3.fill.size_2000x1386.v1736870871.png" alt="Clean baseboard" width="2000" height="1386" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-3.fill.size_800x554.v1736870871.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-3.fill.size_1400x970.v1736870871.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJS4G48GK16TV8HCADHCWSA/images-3.fill.size_2000x1386.v1736870871.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Resplendent!</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<h2 id="fabuloso-experiment-results">Fabuloso experiment results</h2><p>Here's the thing: Both of these products do the same job. The cleanliness of the baseboard overall is not in question after using either product. What is truly different is the cleaning <em>process</em>. I counted how many swipes of my paper towel it took to remove the dirt from each side of the baseboard. With the normal Fabuloso, I was looking at about 25 swipes. With the concentrated version, the number of swipes was <em>seven</em>. This means, per my findings, you need less product or less effort to get your desired result. Even if the 2x-concentrated Fabuloso cost a lot more than the normal one, which it doesn't really, it would be worth it, which is the same conclusion I came to after needing to use significantly less of the double-concentrated Pine Sol than I would of the normal version over the last few months, too. </p><p>Something else I've noticed is that the smell is stronger in the concentrated version. For me, that's a major selling point. I don't just want things to look and feel clean, but smell clean, too, and the 2x-concentrated cleaners that I have used have all had stronger scents than their standard contemporaries and those stronger scents have lasted longer, too. I completed my Fabuloso experiment about 45 minutes ago and can still smell the double-concentrated peach scent. The lavender, unfortunately, has already started to dissipate. </p><p>Overall, I recommend these concentrated formulas and consider them a quality innovation on the part of Big Cleaning. In what I can only hope will be the long years of my life, I am sure to run into more gimmicks and money grabs, but I do not consider this to be among them. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-a-grazing-soup">What to expect from a grazing soup</h2><p>The point of a grazing soup (or stew) is that it&rsquo;s filling, simple, and something that you can make as a great big batch for snacking on throughout the day. You could do this in a large pot or Dutch oven on the stove, but I prefer using my slow cooker because it&rsquo;s more hands-off, and once it&rsquo;s finished, the cooker automatically clicks over to &ldquo;keep warm&rdquo; for as many hours as I want. It&rsquo;s certainly safer than keeping my stove flame on for six hours.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The key to a grazing soup is choosing ingredients that don&rsquo;t deteriorate over the course of the day. You can use my recipe below, but if you&rsquo;re creating your own version of a grazing soup, consider the types of ingredients you&rsquo;re using. Carrots, celery, many cruciferous vegetables (like cauliflower and kale), beans, and bitter greens are good candidates that hold up in liquid. Potatoes can work too, but some potatoes stay together better than others. Opt for waxy potatoes (red potatoes are a good choice) because they have a lower starch content and hold their shape in liquid.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-to-keep-it-interesting">How to keep it interesting&nbsp;</h2><p>If eating the same soup all day sounds like a bore, you can still reap the benefits of not cooking multiple times while adding a bit of variety. You can do this with pre-made accoutrements or with (what I&rsquo;ve decided to call) soup evolution.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Adding pre-made accoutrements</strong> might be a scoop of leftover pasta or rice you didn&rsquo;t finish from earlier in the week. If you keep hard boiled eggs in the fridge, slice one of those into your bowl. I often keep Trader Joe&rsquo;s frozen turkey meatballs in my freezer. They&rsquo;re fully cooked so maybe a half hour before my next graze, I&rsquo;ll drop a few of those into the soup to heat up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Soup evolution</strong> is adding a new bulk ingredient to your grazing soup as it begins to run out. Halfway through the day, after the soup has decreased in volume, I might dump in a can of chickpeas&mdash;aquafaba and all. Maybe before dinner, you add a bag of frozen pelmeni, or a half-cup of raw pastina to the stew and it absorbs the rest of the broth to become a thicker dish. The soup essentially changes over from one major component to another, while still keeping a percentage of its former self.&nbsp;</p><p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this red lentil soup with a chickpea evolution in the evening. Enjoy your grazing soup early and often throughout the day.</p><h2 id="red-lentil-slow-cooker-grazing-soup-recipe">Red Lentil Slow Cooker Grazing Soup Recipe</h2><p>Ingredients:</p><ul><li><p>&frac12; onion, minced</p></li><li><p>2 waxy, medium-sized potatoes, cubed</p></li><li><p>&frac34; cup chopped carrots</p></li><li><p>&frac34; cup dry red lentils</p></li><li><p>2 cups lacinato kale, de-stemmed and roughly chopped</p></li><li><p>4 cups chicken broth</p></li><li><p>&frac12; teaspoon salt</p></li><li><p>&frac14; teaspoon MSG</p></li><li><p>&frac14; teaspoon garlic powder</p></li><li><p>&#8539; teaspoon cayenne pepper powder</p></li><li><p>2 teaspoons lemon juice</p></li><li><p>1 can organic chickpeas (optional), not drained</p></li></ul><p>1.

      <title>How to Reduce Your Mac's Internet Data Usage (and When You Should)</title>

      <description>For the times you're relying on hotspots or limited internet connections.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an independent journalist, I travel a fair bit, and often work from remote locations. This means I often have to use a personal hotspot or a slow, metered connection and that forces me to limit bandwidth usage. All the while, my Mac downloads large app updates, OS updates, and sends large packets of data as apps phone home. All of these can be a big problem when I'm traveling and working. That's why I lean on apps that limit my Mac's data usage under certain conditions. You should too.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-restrict-your-macs-internet-usage">Why you should restrict your Mac's internet usage</h2><p>Generally, Macs&nbsp;are good at restricting data usage when on a hotspot, but not so much when using metered connections while traveling. Even with those features, I've noticed that when I use my iPhone as a hotspot, sometimes an app starts syncing in the background and downloads an abnormally large amount of data. This slows down the connection for tasks that actually need a lot of bandwidth, and it accelerates battery drain on the iPhone, which is running the hotspot.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt these problems acutely on the day I was working from a coffee shop where it took a good 20 minutes to upload a few images. The culprit? Someone sent me a large video around the same time. Had the same thing happened at a hotel with limited free internet, I'd have exhausted my bandwidth for the day before I even started working. Fortunately, you can avoid such situations by using a few strategic tools. </p><h2 id="how-to-restrict-your-macs-internet-data-usage">How to restrict your Mac's internet data usage</h2><p>There are a few different ways to stop apps on your Mac from downloading a bunch of data when you need the bandwidth for other tasks. The easiest one is to use the built-in low-data mode on your Mac. This reduces data usage on specific wifi networks and it is enabled by default every time your Mac connects to a personal hotspot.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="enabling-low-data-mode-for-wifi-networks-on-mac">Enabling low data mode for wifi networks on Mac</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To enable it for other wifi networks, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and go to <strong>System Settings &gt; Wi-Fi</strong>. The connected wifi network will appear on the right, and you can click the <strong>Details&hellip;</strong> button. Enable <strong>Low data mode</strong> and you're all set.

<p>Macs are decent at reducing data usage, but the issue is you don't have much control over the process. To change that, you can rely on third-party apps. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/tripmode/id1513400665?mt=12" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TripMode</a> has been around for a long time, and it's one of the best ways to add data caps to your Mac. The app allows you to set up multiple profiles and add data limits to them accordingly. It can use your location to determine which profile to activate, further reducing the need to fiddle with the app. You can set up a data cap, which is 1GB for most hotels that I visit, and ask it to reset the counter daily, weekly, monthly, or at custom intervals.</p><p>You can even schedule TripMode to run at certain times of the day, which is convenient if you run into time-based metered data networks. I've come across networks where you're allowed to use unlimited bandwidth from 12 a.m. to 7 a.m., but there's a data cap during the day. TripMode works for that too. Once you've configured TripMode, you can control the app through the menu bar. Click its menu bar icon and you can use the drop-down menu to switch profiles and uncheck the box next to any app to block its data.</p><p>TripMode is a good app, but it hasn't had an update in about nine months (as of this article). This caused a problem during the installation process. The app asked me to install a system extension and when I clicked the button to do so, it took me to the wrong settings page on the Mac. The correct page can be found at <strong>System Settings &gt; General &gt; Login Items &amp; Extensions &gt; Network Extensions</strong>. When you enable TripMode on this page, you'll be able to proceed with the installation. You can try this app for free for a week, and beyond that, it costs $5.99 per month.</p><h2 id="datacever-lets-you-monitor-app-data-usage">Datacever lets you monitor app data usage</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As much as I like Tripmode's customizations, it can be intimidating to someone who just wants to press a couple buttons and block apps from hogging bandwidth. For those who prefer a simpler interface, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/datacever/id1545742098" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">DataCever</a> ($6.99) is a good alternative I discovered <a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/datacever-simple-data-control-when-you-have-to-tether-your-mac" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">thanks to App Addict</a>. This, too, hasn't been updated in a long time, but I faced no issues during the installation process. Once I got it running, I clicked the menu bar icon and unchecked the apps I wanted to block from the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Datacever neatly divides the list of apps into three tabs&mdash;<strong>All</strong>,<strong> System</strong>, and <strong>Apps</strong>. This arrangement let you quickly locate specific system processes or apps you wish to keep offline. You can also go to the app's settings and set up data caps for individual apps using the slider. You can set a cap of up to 1GB for each app, which is great, but I'd like greater flexibility here. If I could manually type the data limit instead of using a slider to set it, I'd find this a lot easier to do.&nbsp;</p><p>The appeal of Datacever is in its simple UI and pricing model. Some people prefer buying apps in one go instead of making recurring payments. However, it lacks the advanced features that make TripMode worth using.</p><p>As an alternative to these apps, you can also consider <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-should-use-a-firewall-on-your-mac-but-not-apples" target="_blank">using firewall apps on your Mac</a>. Apps such as <a href="https://radiosilenceapp.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Radio Silence</a> and <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Little Snitch</a> stop apps from phoning home, and even though they're overkill for restricting data usage on hotspots, you can easily use those apps for the job.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>A cheap way to turn your iPhone into a Game Boy console.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JHJ6EEZS21XK7FNV57KT4NVW/hero-image.png"/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/how-to-emulate-nintendo-sega-games-on-iphone" target="_blank">Retro game emulators</a> are finally on the App Store, and they're thriving. Apps like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-best-game-emulators-for-iphone" target="_blank">Delta and RetroArch</a> let users play old retro Nintendo and console games with ease. The software side of retro gaming is surprisingly mature; the hardware side, however, has some catching up to do. </p><p>Playing retro games using touchscreen controls leaves a lot to be desired, and you can't always carry a game controller with you everywhere you go. This is where Bitmo Lab's new <a href="https://www.bitmolab.com/pages/gamebaby" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Gamebaby controller case</a> comes in.</p><p>It's an iPhone case that's split in two. The bottom part is a game controller with support for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and NES games. According to Gamebaby, the layout supports more than 7000 games that use the Game Boy button layout. (This only works when you're playing games in the vertical orientation.) The case features a D-pad, A/B buttons, Start, Select, and shoulder buttons for more advanced games.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>You first mount it as a regular iPhone case. The bottom part, which emulates the Game Boy controller, slides off with ease. It can then be flipped and mounted to the front of the iPhone, and is secured with a satisfying snap.</p><p>This is purely a mechanical case: There is no Bluetooth support, no wifi, no charging cable. On the back of the buttons you'll find those squishy silicone pads that will press the touchscreen buttons for you. All the magic happens via Delta's custom skins for Game Boy controllers. The touchscreen button placement is taken care of automatically.</p><p>Because these aren't real, electronic buttons, don't expect super-fast response times or huge tactical feedback. (When you're playing old Pok&eacute;mon games, that's not really the feel you're going for, anyway.) </p><p>Currently, the case is available only in one color, and is designed only for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPhone 16 Pro Max (hopefully other smaller iPhones will be supported soon). Gamebaby is available to pre-order at an early bird price of $24.99; when it officially launches, it will retail for $39.99. You can order Gamebaby <a href="https://www.bitmolab.com/pages/gamebaby" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">directly from their website</a>, and they plan to release the product in the first half of 2025.</p><p>Gamebaby isn't the only exciting game controller coming out this year. At <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-products-ces-2025" target="_blank">CES 2025</a>, Lifehacker's Michelle Ehrhardt got to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/ces-2025-the-mcon-magsafe-phone-controller-is-my-best-of-show-so-far" target="_blank">play around with MCON</a>, a MagSafe-compatible slide-out controller case for iPhone and other smartphones. MCON will be the first case available in this slim form factor, and a full controller, along with D-pad and joysticks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If early reports <em>are</em> indicative of future results, 2025 is going to be a messed up year. We're barely two weeks in, and already the kids are leaving TikTok, accusing Elon Musk of cheating at video games, and drinking water from glaciers. </p><h2 id="self-proclaimed-tiktok-refugees-are-flocking-to-red-note">Self-proclaimed "TikTok refugees" are flocking to Red Note</h2><p>An online group calling themselves "TikTok refugees" are downloading an app called RedNote in advance of a possible TikTok shutdown. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has vowed to start winding down the app in the U.S. early next week, leaving 170 million U.S. users unable to watch trending dance videos or share their personal information with the Chinese government. </p><p>In advance of the possible shutdown, young people are searching for an alternative. That alternative for many is &#23567;&#32418;&#20070;, also known as Xiaohongshu in Mandarin or "RedNote" in English. The social media app is currently at the top of Apple's App Store's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%E5%B0%8F%E7%BA%A2%E4%B9%A6/id741292507" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">most downloaded chart,</a> despite not being available in English.</p><p>The potential TikTok ex-pats are already posting videos on both TikTok and RedNote where they give each other tips on navigating an app in a language you can't read or speak, or simply reacting to what it's like to use RedNote. Consider <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xlvxlv1" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TikToker xlvxlv1</a>, who simply says, "I'm here and I'm scared:"</p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7459234490443992366" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>In the most interesting TikTok/RedNote crossposts, users talk about why they're switching to a Chinese social media platform when Western options like Instagram and Facebook are readily available. Turns out they're actually picking RedNote <em>because</em> it's Chinese. The government shutting down TikTok is seen as censorship, and many think the <em>real</em> reason the U.S. is banning TikTok isn't over "national security concerns," but because of one man: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Here's how new <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/6784563c000000000b014972?xsec_token=AB9saCwNw0AtXRmnJoFgzSzU5aAzOYfNo9iji-9g25z_s=&amp;xsec_source=pc_user" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">RedNote user Candacce</a> explains it: "I would rather stare at a language I can't understand than to ever use a social media that Zuckerberg owns. Mark Zuckerberg lobbying to congress so TikTok gets banned and everyone has to use his social media&mdash;it feels like when he was in college and he would try to force people to be friends with him." <em>Burn</em>.</p><p>I don't know whether Zuckerberg's congressional lobbying is a factor in the TikTok ban, but if TikTokkers think it is, I doubt any of those young people are going back to one of Zuck's properties. Most of TikTok's users are under 30, and they see Facebook and Insta as apps for old people. They're essentially uncool, and once you have that image, you're not going to shake it&mdash;just ask anyone labeled a nerd on the first day of freshman year.  </p><h2 id="viral-video-of-the-week-does-elon-musk-cheat-at-video-games">Viral video of the week: Does Elon Musk cheat at video games?</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-qpXu9ft9h4M"></div>
</div>


<p>In other "billionaires who are totally childish" news, let's talk about Elon Musk, the subject of this week's viral video. Musk, an adult, recently posted <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1876697674264813998" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a video of himself playing video game</a> <em>Path of Exile 2</em> on X,<em> </em>ostensibly to test the site's streaming capabilities, but really so he could show off the totally cool armor or magic wands or whatever bullshit his character, "Percy_Verence," uses in the game. (Yes, that's really what Musk chose as his character name.) Musk clearly wanted to brag about his high rank in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. "This is max difficulty, on hardcore," Musk, a grown man, proudly proclaimed on the stream. </p><p>That would be funny/pathetic (fathetic?) enough, but probably not fathetic enough to go viral. But then actual players of <em>Path of Exile 2</em> analyzed Musk's stream and concluded that the richest man in the world is a gaming <em>fraud</em>, and hires other people to play a video game <em>for him, </em>presumably so he can look cool to people who really do play video games a lot. </p><p><em>"</em>He clearly has no idea," says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Quin69TV" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">YouTuber Quin69TV</a>, "100 percent, some guy plays this account for him," he added. </p><p>I can't say whether what Quinn69 and others say is true (I'm an adult but not Elon Musk, so I don't know anything about <em>Path of Exile 2</em>) but the YouTube video evidence seems compelling. But mostly it's hilarious. I can't believe Elon Musk is a real person, and not the main character in a poorly regarded Adam Sandler movie from 2004. </p><h2 id="the-controversy-over-what-ts-means-online">The controversy over what "TS" means online</h2><p>I like to keep up with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/guide-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-slang" target="_blank">the slang kids use</a>, so I was all ready to tell you the "TS" means "this" when used online, but that's only partly true. Like most modern online slang, TS originally comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">AAVE</a>, where it means "this shit" or "that shit." </p><p>In a way, "this shit" is just a different way of saying "this" anyway, but the whole thing highlights the "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/why-are-people-using-ts-to-mean-this-the-failed-appropriation-of-the-aave-slang-term-explained" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">AAVE to Brainrot pipeline</a>" that has claimed words like "rizz" and "gyatt." (The slang word "skibidi" does not have origins in AAVE, however; it's native Brainrot.)</p><p>Is TS's widespread use another example of appropriation? Probably. A lot of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justmy_twocents/video/7224376591311457582" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">people online think so</a>, anyway. Whether there's anything anyone can do about it is a different question; language tends to develop how it develops, regardless of whether people like it or not. </p><h2 id="warning-do-not-drink-water-from-glaciers">Warning: Do not drink water from glaciers</h2><p>In part 4,623 of my 9,690 series "Don't Do Anything You See Online," let's consider videos of people drinking the melted run-off from glaciers. If you're thinking this sounds like a great idea, I have news for you: It is not. </p><p>The trend has been growing in popularity among people who have the means to travel to faraway places to drink melted ice, including rapper Ludacris, who sampled the meltwater from an Alaskan glacier recently and posted video evidence. </p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7407523057339780394" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>I can't deny that the glacier water looks mighty refreshing, but apparently, there are lots of things in water that you <em>can't see</em>. Scientists (remember them?) have studied ice from glaciers and found it <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01106-w" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">rife with microbes</a>. It seems bacteria, phages (which are viruses that live <em>inside</em> bacteria), and other creatures pollute our ancient glaciers. There could be something <em>else</em> in there too&mdash;something sinister that's been waiting for thousands of years for its chance to strike. "We know very little about viruses and microbes in these extreme environments,"  Lonnie Thompson, a glaciologist, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2022/06/28/melting-glaciers-could-release-deadly-microbes-scientists-suggest/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">told Forbes</a>. </p><p>Until proven otherwise, I'm going to assume that Ludacris has been taken over by the creature from John Carpenter's <em>The Thing, </em>and our current Ludacris is a murderous alien simulacra. Also, I've changed my mind: Drink as much glacier water as you want. Whatever happens to you can't be worse than just existing in 2025. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>This New Text Scam Tries to Get You to Disable an iPhone Security Feature</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern-day smartphones come with a whole host of proactive security features built right in. Scammers and hackers will often try to trick you into disabling or bypassing these safety measures&mdash;which is exactly what a newly discovered text phishing con tries to get you to do.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-texts-trick-apple-imessage-users-into-disabling-protection/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">BleepingComputer</a>, the SMS-based ruse can be recognized by the way it tries to get you to reply with a "Y" to enable a link embedded in the text. The message might also get you to copy and paste the link into Safari.</p><p>Replying to the message or moving the link elsewhere gets around a key security measure in iOS: Links from senders who are not in your contacts list are <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iph203ab0be4/ios" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">disabled by default</a>. The feature is so critical to iPhone security that you can't toggle it on or off&mdash;it's a built-in part of the Messages app you can't change.</p><p>Replying with a "Y" (or any other response) makes iOS think you know the sender, and once you restart the Messages app (as the scam text will tell you to do), the link will be tappable&mdash;and take you to some kind of fraudulent, credential-stealing website.</p><p>According to the fine folks at BleepingComputer, there has been a surge in these types of messages since the middle of last year. Texts purporting to come from courier companies and demands for road toll payments are a couple of the scam messages that have been spotted in that time.</p><h2 id="how-to-keep-yourself-safe">How to keep yourself safe</h2><p>One member of the Lifehacker team has recently seen a message fitting this description, demanding payment for an outstanding toll bill. The familiar trick of pushing the message recipient to act quickly&mdash;in this case to avoid paying even more&mdash;is used.</p><p>It's worth bearing in mind (and reminding family and friends) that even in the best-case scenarios, you should be very wary of following links that arrive over messaging apps and email. Ideally, you only want to respond to links you're expecting: To track a delivery you've ordered, for example, or to confirm your email address for a new account.</p><p>Even messages that appear to come from trusted contacts can be faked&mdash;maybe an account impersonating them has been created, or maybe hackers have managed to get access to their accounts, for example. If you get a link from someone you know, double-check with them that it's genuine before following it.</p><p>Note that there are two parts to scams like this: The first is getting you to follow the link, and the second is getting you to enter sensitive information (like credit card details or an account password) on a fraudulent website. Even if you are tricked into following a dodgy link, as long as you're able to spot a spoofed webpage, you're okay: Look for weird formatting, a URL that <a href="https://lifehacker.com/don-t-log-in-to-websites-with-sites-in-the-url-1850110238" target="_blank">doesn't make sense</a>, and other inconsistencies.</p><p>Today's operating systems and web browsers have plenty of built-in protection against phishing sites, so&mdash;as always&mdash;make sure all of your software is kept up-to-date to minimize the risk of getting caught out. And always avoid responding to any message from an unknown and unverified sender, whether it's with "Y" or with "STOP" to supposedly stop future messages. That just identifies you as a potential future target.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The LG B3 OLED sits as something of a budget version of the LG C3, which PC Mag gave an "outstanding" rating in <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lg-c3-55-inch-evo-oled-tv-oled55c3pua" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>their review</u></a> for its color, contrast, and design. The LG B3 carries over a lot of those same qualities. The OLED panel naturally has exceptional contrast, as black pixels simply turn off to deliver contrast that LCD-based panels can&rsquo;t match. And the B3 gets a similarly wide color gamut for beautiful visuals. These visual talents are paired with the LG B3&rsquo;s support for HDR10 and Dolby Vision content.&nbsp;</p><p>The LG B3 also has much in store for gamers. The display can run at up to 120Hz with both ALLM (auto low latency mode) and VRR (variable refresh rate), allowing for super-smooth, responsive, clear gaming. That&rsquo;s on top of another advantage OLED panels bring: their super-fast pixel response time, which helps avoid motion blur in games.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's true that <a href="https://lifehacker.com/is-added-protein-in-packaged-food-really-healthier-1839263716" target="_blank"><u>protein-boosted foods are trendy</u></a>, and that they're not necessarily great dietary choices in the big picture. It's also true that you can eat a healthy diet with little to no meat, but meat is not synonymous with protein. Let's look at what we <em>actually</em> know about the role of protein in a healthy diet, and how to tell if you're eating too much or too little.</p><h2 id="what-foods-contain-protein">What foods contain protein?&nbsp;</h2><p>As a refresher, protein is one of the three calorie-containing macronutrients (fats, carbs, protein) that make up most of the food we eat. Proteins are made of amino acids, and these amino acids are required for the growth, repair, and functioning of our body.&nbsp;</p><p>We can get protein from a variety of sources. Meats are particularly protein-dense; a chicken breast contains about 35 grams of protein. Other animal products, like milk and eggs, are also rich in protein. Plant-based foods tend to have less protein than animal products, but it&rsquo;s not hard to meet or exceed protein requirements even on a vegan diet. Beans, grains, and soy products like tofu contain significant amounts of protein, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like a cheat sheet on how much protein you&rsquo;re supposed to eat based on your activity level, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/heres-how-much-protein-you-really-need-1830878049" target="_blank"><u>you can find one here</u></a>. And that&rsquo;s a good place to start dissecting this &ldquo;too much protein&rdquo; myth, because before we can declare an amount of protein to be &ldquo;too much,&rdquo; we need to understand how much is &ldquo;enough.&rdquo;</p><h2 id="the-rda-is-meant-to-be-considered-a-minimum">The RDA is meant to be considered a <em>minimum</em>&nbsp;</h2><p>The government communicates targets for different nutrients to encourage us all to eat a healthy, balanced diet. These targets are the basis for the &ldquo;% daily value&rdquo; labels on the back of packaged foods, and for the nutrient makeup of school lunches.&nbsp;The RDA, or recommended daily allowance, is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45182/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>defined</u></a> as &ldquo;the average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in a group.&rdquo;</p><p>In other words, if 100% of us were to eat the RDA of protein, at least 97% of us would be getting <em>enough</em> protein&mdash;we'd be meeting the minimum to be healthy. That's right, this number is a minimum to avoid malnutrition, not a maximum, and not a recommendation for optimal health. </p><p>By the way, if you're wondering how that number is determined? For protein, it is <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10490/chapter/12#635" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>based on nitrogen balance</u></a>. Humans break down proteins, excreting nitrogen, as part of the body&rsquo;s daily function. If you eat enough protein (which contains nitrogen), the amount of nitrogen you excrete will be the same as, or more than, the amount you eat. In other words, if you aren&rsquo;t breaking your own body proteins down (in excess of what you eat), then whatever you&rsquo;re eating must be, in some sense, enough.&nbsp;</p><p>In this way of thinking, the RDA is the minimum to stay healthy. More is fine; less would mean that you may not be getting enough. For some nutrients, there is also an UL, or upper limit, telling you that more than a certain amount is too much. Upper limits are calculated for vitamins and minerals; <strong>there is no upper limit defined for protein</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, there is no official definition for &ldquo;too much&rdquo; protein. If somebody eats more than the RDA, they&rsquo;re not eating too much; they&rsquo;re just eating more than the minimum. You&rsquo;re <em>supposed</em> to eat more than the minimum.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-much-is-the-rda-for-protein-and-how-much-is-the-average-american-actually-eating">How much is the RDA for protein, and how much is the average American actually eating?</h2><p>The RDA for protein is set at 46 grams per day for a 125-pound woman, and at 56 grams per day for a 154-pound man. That&rsquo;s based on an RDA of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram bodyweight, which works out to 0.36 grams per pound. So a 200-pound person would need 72 grams of protein per day.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1720/Table_1_NIN_GEN_1720.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>This USDA report</u></a> found that most adult men average between roughly 90 to 100 grams of protein per day, although men aged 70 and up only get about 80 grams of protein per day. Women tend to average around 70 grams per day, with those aged 70 and up averaging 62 grams.&nbsp;</p><p>Above the RDA? Yes. Too much? I don&rsquo;t see any way of arguing that. And before you say that we&rsquo;re getting almost double the recommendation, let's check the math. Those RDA numbers are for 125- and 154-pound people. On the other hand, the averages for what we eat are based on <em>actual people</em>, not ideals. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>The average American man is 200 pounds, and the average American woman is 171 pounds</u></a>. So, to compare the numbers: &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The average woman is 171 pounds, so her RDA would be 62 grams per day. (Women, on average, eat 70 grams of protein per day.)</p></li><li><p>The average man is 200 pounds, so his RDA would be 72 grams per day. (Men, on average, eat 90 to 100 grams of protein per day.)</p></li></ul><p>Again, there&rsquo;s no need to stick to the minimum; going 8 grams over, or even 28 grams over, is fine. It&rsquo;s probably better to go over than to just scrape by, and many of us arguably don&rsquo;t get enough. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="many-older-adults-dont-get-enough-protein">Many older adults don&rsquo;t get enough protein</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s start with older adults. Not only does protein intake tend to decrease with age, older adults are vulnerable to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4066461/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>issues that stem from a loss of muscle mass</u></a>. People tend to lose 3-5% of their muscle mass per decade starting at age 30, but strength training and protein intake can support maintaining our muscle, and thus likely prevent or reduce that decline.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Dietary Guidelines</u></a> include a note that &ldquo;About 50 percent of women and 30 percent of men 71 and older fall short of protein foods recommendations.&rdquo; Meanwhile, a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1174-1" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>study</u></a> found that older adults who don&rsquo;t meet the recommendations are &ldquo;more likely to be limited when stooping, crouching, or kneeling, standing or sitting for long periods, walking up 10 steps, preparing meals, and walking for a quarter mile.&rdquo;</p><p>So even if it&rsquo;s true that the <em>average</em> adult gets more protein than recommended, there are clearly a lot of elderly folks who don&rsquo;t. These are the same people who have more issues functioning in everyday life. This may be a chicken-and-egg situation&mdash;was the functional decline a <em>cause</em> or an <em>effect</em> of the change in their diet?&mdash;but this sure does not seem to be a group of people who should be eating <em>less</em> protein.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="you-need-more-than-the-default-rda-if-youre-pregnant-or-lactating">You need more than the default RDA if you&rsquo;re pregnant or lactating</h2><p>There&rsquo;s another large group of people who benefit from more, not less, protein: people who are pregnant or lactating. Instead of 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (62 grams for a 171-pound person), the RDA for people who are pregnant or lactating is 0.5 grams/pound (so, <strong>86 grams of protein per day</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>When you&rsquo;re pregnant, you also have higher caloric needs, so the increased total amount of food makes it easier to get the higher protein amount. Still, it makes more sense to spend your energy on making sure you&rsquo;re getting <em>enough</em> protein, rather than worrying about getting too much.</p><h2 id="higher-protein-diets-support-healthy-exercise-and-muscle-mass">Higher-protein diets support healthy exercise and muscle mass</h2><p>You knew we heading in this direction (I say between reps of barbell squats, wiping protein shake off my lips): People who exercise should get more protein than just the RDA.&nbsp;</p><p>While the fear-mongering &ldquo;too much protein&rdquo; articles sometimes mention that bodybuilders or elite athletes need their protein, they tend to hand-wave this away as a special concern that doesn&rsquo;t apply to normal people. But I think it&rsquo;s worth a closer look&mdash;and honestly, this situation applies to a <em>lot</em> more people than just a few athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>Officially, there isn&rsquo;t an RDA for athletes; people who exercise can stave off malnutrition with the same 0.36 grams per pound as everyone else. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the RDA is the best target to aim for.</p><p>The International Association of Athletics Federations, which governs track and field competitions, <a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/29/2/article-p73.xml" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>recommends</u></a> that most athletes who are maintaining or gaining weight eat 0.59 to 0.77 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight per day. That&rsquo;s <strong>101 to 131 grams for the average 171-pound woman, and 118 to 154 grams for a 200-pound man</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>A group of organizations including the American College of Sports Medicine largely agrees, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221226721501802X" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>recommending a range from 0.54 to 0.9 grams per pound</u></a> for all athletes whose weight is stable or gaining. That includes people who do endurance training like distance running, as well as strength athletes whose exercise involves mainly lifting weights. Those ranges would go as high as <strong>153 grams for our 171-pound woman, and 180 grams for our 200-pound man</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need to be an Olympian to consider yourself an &ldquo;athlete&rdquo; in this sense. If you&rsquo;re training for a half marathon, you&rsquo;re doing plenty of distance running, and should fuel accordingly. And if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;just&rdquo; lifting weights in the gym, but taking it seriously enough that you&rsquo;re training regularly and working hard, you should consider eating in these ranges as well.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="higher-protein-diets-support-healthy-weight-loss">Higher-protein diets support healthy weight loss</h2><p>Dieting to lose weight is not only a popular American pastime, it&rsquo;s also arguably good for at least some of your health. If you&rsquo;ve been on a diet recently, or if you&rsquo;re planning to go on one, you aren&rsquo;t a person who should settle for the RDA either.&nbsp;</p><p>Research shows that protein intake (and strength training&mdash;they go together!) is important to maintain muscle mass when we&rsquo;re losing weight. After all, you&rsquo;re aiming for <em>fat</em> loss, not trying to get your muscles to waste away.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7539343/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>this study</u></a> found that diets ranging from 0.48 to 0.72 grams of protein per kg of body weight (that&rsquo;s <strong>82 to 123 grams for our 171-pound woman, 96 to 144 for our 200-pound man</strong>) resulted in less weight regain after the diet, and helped people to maintain muscle mass and feel more full while they were dieting.</p><p>And if you&rsquo;re losing weight <em>and</em> exercising? The IAAF recommends that athletes who are &ldquo;undertaking high-quality weight loss&rdquo; need <em>at least</em> 0.72 grams per pound of bodyweight, and possibly as much as 1.09 grams per pound. That would be <strong>186 grams for a 171-pound athlete, or 218 grams for a 200-pound athlete</strong>. Most people won&rsquo;t need to go that high, and it&rsquo;s unclear whether athletes need to go that high. But I&rsquo;m including these numbers so you see how high the ranges actually go.</p><p>Ultimately, weight loss is widely understood to be more effective and have healthier results with higher protein intakes rather than lower ones. When people focus on just <em>eating less</em>, without thinking about what their diet actually consists of, it&rsquo;s easy to forget about protein. But the evidence suggests that you should <em>increase</em> protein when you&rsquo;re decreasing overall calories.</p><h2 id="does-too-much-protein-turn-into-fat">Does &ldquo;too much&rdquo; protein turn into fat?&nbsp;</h2><p>This is a common talking point in those articles about &ldquo;too much&rdquo; protein, and it&rsquo;s sort of true&mdash;but it also doesn&rsquo;t mean what you think it means.&nbsp;</p><p>When you eat more food than your body needs, your body can store it as fat. That&rsquo;s true no matter what the excess is made of&mdash;protein, carbs, fat, or even alcohol. The protein you eat gets used for many different things in your body. You can build it into muscle tissue, use it for growth and repair of different kinds of cells, and so on. You can also use it for energy&mdash;basically, burning it for the calories.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you were eating a perfectly balanced diet, and then decided to add an extra 100 grams of protein per day, then sure, a lot of that protein would be used for energy, and since we&rsquo;d have excess energy, it would get stored as fat.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you ate more protein, and that protein <em>replaced</em> other foods in your diet, then there would be no excess calories to store. Nobody is saying you should chug a couple of protein shakes on top of your regular diet. They&rsquo;re saying (I&rsquo;m saying) that you should plan your meals and snacks to <em>include</em> more protein.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if your regular lunch is a turkey-and-cheese sandwich with a side of chips, you could improve the protein content of your diet by adding more turkey to the sandwich and replacing the chips with an apple. Same total calories, but more protein. <strong>As long as your total calories for the day aren&rsquo;t in excess of your needs, the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; protein won&rsquo;t get stored as fat.</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="is-it-bad-to-get-too-much-protein">Is it bad to get too much protein?</h2><p>In general, high protein diets don&rsquo;t have any serious health consequences. There&rsquo;s a major exception, though: in some medical conditions, you may be told to limit your protein intake to protect your health.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <a href="https://kidneyhi.org/blog/understanding-the-renal-diet-protein/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>people with chronic kidney disease</u></a> are often advised to use the RDA (0.36 grams per pound of body weight) as a maximum rather than a minimum. Your kidneys play a role in processing protein for excretion, so a lowered protein intake reduces the amount of work that a damaged kidney has to do. That said, once a person with chronic kidney disease begins dialysis, they may be <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/ckd-diet-how-much-protein-right-amount#dialysis-increase-protein" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>advised to increase their protein intake for better health</u></a> now that their body has help to handle the higher levels.</p><p>People with certain other disorders, like phenylketonuria and homocystinuria, may also be advised to eat a low protein diet. Obviously, if you have one of these conditions, you should be getting your dietary advice from your medical team (ask for a referral to a dietitian!) rather than from general articles on the internet.</p><h2 id="wasnt-there-a-study-that-said-too-much-protein-is-bad">Wasn&rsquo;t there a study that said too much protein is bad?&nbsp;</h2><p>Besides those known medical issues, the occasional findings about eating &ldquo;too much&rdquo; protein tend to fit into the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-scientists-seem-like-they-re-always-changing-their-1818542967" target="_blank"><u>&ldquo;X is good for you/X is bad for you&rdquo; ricochet news cycle</u></a>. They&rsquo;re not holistic assessments of protein <em>in general</em> on health <em>in general</em>, but rather specific research questions that are still being figured out.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748742/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>this study</u></a> found that a high protein (and high fiber) diet seemed to slightly worsen one measure of insulin resistance; but it also improved metabolic health and body composition. The researchers concluded that the subjects&rsquo; body chemistry was probably just responding appropriately to the changed nutrient content of their diet. A few years later, a study of high-BMI women with insulin resistance <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8707429/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>saw improvements to their insulin resistance on a high protein diet</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or to take another example, a study earlier this year <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eating-this-much-protein-can-be-bad-for-your-heart-heath" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>found a link</u></a> between high protein diets and atherosclerosis. But if you look at what the researchers were actually studying, they were looking at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-00984-2" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>how leucine (one amino acid found in protein) affects the mTOR biochemical pathway in certain types of white blood cells</u></a>. By the way, that mTOR pathway is involved in a lot more body processes than atherosclerosis, and does a lot of good things too.&nbsp;</p><p>So are these results interesting, and worth further study? Definitely. Worth changing protein recommendations? Only if this effect turns out (1) to actually lead to worse health outcomes, and (2) to outweigh the known benefits of higher protein. The body of evidence doesn&rsquo;t support lowering protein recommendations, nor adding an upper limit.</p><h2 id="theres-no-urgent-health-problem-that-lowering-our-protein-intake-will-solve">There&rsquo;s no urgent health problem that lowering our protein intake will solve</h2><p>So if protein is good for us, and most of us can&rsquo;t really get &ldquo;too much,&rdquo; why are so many people arguing that we&rsquo;re overdoing it?&nbsp;</p><p>I think part of the reason is just misunderstanding (the writers don&rsquo;t tend to have a background in nutrition and especially not in sports nutrition), but more often, I think they&rsquo;re talking about a different issue entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>Often the &ldquo;too much protein&rdquo; stuff is just a way of talking about the environmental effects of meat consumption or dairy farming. People making this argument are trying to pry the double cheeseburgers out of our hands and reassuring us that we&rsquo;ll be okay. I don&rsquo;t think an attack on protein is an appropriate way to make that point, since plant-based proteins exist and are a fine alternative. But I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, if you&rsquo;re trying to make the argument that we&rsquo;re eating &ldquo;too much&rdquo; protein for our health, you really can&rsquo;t do that without some evidence that we&rsquo;re eating so much protein that it&rsquo;s harming our health on a widespread level. And that evidence just doesn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand that point, just look at the <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</u></a>. This is the master document that tells us what we should be eating and what government programs should be funding. The goals include reducing rates of heart disease and diabetes, and making sure people get enough vitamins. There are <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/top-10-things-you-need-know" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Key Recommendations</u></a> to limit certain nutrients&mdash;specifically sugars, saturated fats, sodium, and alcohol. There is <em>no</em> recommendation to reduce your intake of protein.</p><p><em>Corrected 1/15/2025 to note that we lose 3-5% of our muscle mass per decade, not per year, without training. </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

And while I'm not an expert in government, I <em>am</em> a savvy social media user who knows people are worried about their followers, followed accounts, and saved videos disappearing. If you get your cleaning and organizing inspiration from TikTok&mdash;where <a href="https://lifehacker.com/15-of-the-best-cleantok-accounts-to-follow-on-tiktok-1849838334" target="_blank">CleanTokkers have always been popular content creators</a>&mdash;you may want to know of comparable Instagram accounts that you can look into as a replacement.

It's soothing to watch her transform grimy surfaces with a pass of a rag, and even if your home isn't as messy as the ones she deals with, you can always learn something from watching the way she maneuvers her vacuum or the taking note of the products she swears by.</p><h3>@gocleanco, 2.4 million followers</h3><p>The videos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gocleanco/#" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">@gocleanco</a> are more direct, how-to-clean posts interspersed with some inspirational, idealistic ones, like shots of a tidy home or holiday decor. Content creator Sarah McAllister is adept at serving up variety, so I often find myself scrolling past something idyllic and eventually browsing details about the best vacuums for sale online (which is great for when I simply want to absorb cleaning knowledge without having to think too hard about it). </p><blockquote class="mx-auto instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8DBvbfSMTA/?igsh=YnltNXBuODc5NGpk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom:1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

<h3>@anna_louisa_at_home, 4.3 million followers</h3><p>Anna Louisa, purveyor of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anna_louisa_at_home" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">@anna_louisa_at_home</a>, is a quality follow. She's the author of the popular book <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXpwA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=The%20Five%20Minute%20Clean%20Routine&amp;short_url=aoXpwA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><em>The Five Minute Clean Routine</em></a>, and her videos are extremely hands-on.  She shares product roundups, hack rundowns, and quick tips&mdash;and I do mean quick, since her whole cleaning philosophy revolves around not spending too much time at it. </p><h2 id="the-best-organizing-accounts-on-instagram">The best organizing accounts on Instagram</h2><p>Some of the best content you can consume is less about cleaning and more about organizing. Speaking from experience, when I see someone share a video of how perfectly tidy and well-contained their stuff is, I get inspired to make my own spaces more organized. Organization lends itself to video content, especially, since before-and-afters are so satisfying, so let these inspire you. </p><h3>@mrshinchhome, 4.8 million followers</h3><p>Sophie Hinchliffe, aka <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrshinchhome/#" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">@mrshinchhome</a>, is one of the most popular organizers out there. I get lost in her calm voiceovers, which accompany videos of her doing tasks like organizing her kids' packed lunches, going over her favorite cleaning and organizing products, and rearranging her home. In addition to great grid posts, her Instagram Stories are full of "reset" inspiration and clips of her sprucing up rooms and surfaces. </p><h3>@the.decluttered.mom, 380k followers</h3><p>@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.decluttered.mom" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the.decluttered.mom</a> is heavy on the inspiration and motivation: The account consistently posts content that gives people space to acknowledge that they're overwhelmed, and then it encourages them to get back in the game. The account has a gentle, helpful approach, and it seems to cheer for anyone who gets off the couch and organizes just one thing. If you need an account to treat you with some kindness instead of shaming you for not living in pristine luxury, this is the one.</p><blockquote class="mx-auto instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEOi9StAufD/?igsh=MWY5aXB3MjVjbHpsYw==/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom:1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

<h3>@organizingspacesbykim, 291k followers</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/organizingspacesbykim" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">@organizingspacesbykim</a> account has a video for everything: Tips on how to unpack if you're moving, ideas for organizing a pantry, and even advice on how to organize a barn. Even though I don't have anything like a barn, I still like watching a professional organizing team working through one, and I still pick up great tips on how to use storage containers and make solid decisions about what to keep or get rid of. This account is also excellent if you're looking for specific product recommendations and want to see exactly how they're used before buying them. </p><h3>@tidydad, 379k followers</h3><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tidydad" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">@Tidydad</a> is a personal favorite of mine. Decluttering and organizing are female-dominated content niches, so it's cool to see a dad get in on the action, and it's great to see how the tidy dad himself, Tyler Moore, organizes his New York City apartment, since I, too, live in a small space.

<p>Both Pelotons are well-priced considering historical prices, but if you can't make up your mind on which one is better for you, Lifehacker Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-peloton-bike-vs-bike-plus" target="_blank"><u>broke down their differences in detail here</u></a>. Essentially, the Peloton Bike has all the important features, like the touchscreen where you follow along classes and can see scenic routes, play games on the screen by adjusting your resistance knob, and even watch Netflix while you exercise. The Bike+ has everything the Bike has, plus resistance that automatically adjusts when you&rsquo;re following along with a class. The touchscreen is also on a swivel, allowing you to do yoga and strength classes on the floor next to your Bike+. Amazon offers free &ldquo;inside entryway&rdquo; delivery when you order a Peloton Bike or Bike+.</p><p>If you're considering buying a used Peloton instead, here is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/peloton-bike-review-1850804329" target="_blank">what you can expect</a>; keep in mind there's a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/used-pelotons-are-still-a-good-deal-even-with-95-fee" target="_blank">$95 fee</a> (plus some <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/the-real-cost-of-a-peloton" target="_blank">other costs you might want to consider</a>) that you'll need to pay Peloton in order for the machine to trade hands. You'll also need a <strong>$44</strong> per-month <a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/s/article/360040396351-Peloton-App-Memberships-vs-Peloton-All-Access-Membership?language=en_US#:~:text=With%20a%20Peloton%20All%2DAccess,and%20real%2Dtime%20performance%20tracking." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>&ldquo;All Access&rdquo; membership</u></a> to use all of the Bike&rsquo;s features. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve tested a ton of bikes since I started doing reviews on Lifehacker in 2023&mdash;from low frills affairs like the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/propella-7s-ebike-review-1850858073" target="_blank">Propella 7S</a> to higher end e-Mountain Bikes like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/canyon-spectralon-cf-7-e-mountain-bike-review-a-weekend-warriors-dream" target="_blank">Canyon&rsquo;s Spectra</a>l&mdash;and while no e-bike is right for every type of rider and every taste, the Centauri II is my overall favorite. I like the <a href="https://vvolt.com/products/centauri-ii" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Vvolt Centauri II</a> so much that I feel the need to open with a disclaimer: I am not getting paid by Vvolt, and Lifehacker has no relationship with the company.  </p><p>For general urban riding&mdash;commuting, shorter trips on paved roads&mdash;the Centauri II is close to perfect. The weight, power, comfort, and handling is balanced for everyday riding, and its features performed better than I expected, including the belt drive with automatic transmission and mid-drive motor.

<p>The Centauri II is a nice-looking bike&mdash;classy instead of flashy, with an overall look that is subtle, refined, and filled with small details that fit together. It comes in two colors, &ldquo;Forest Planet&rdquo; (green) and &ldquo;Galactic Storm&rdquo; (white), and has a matte finish. The cables are managed nicely, with most hidden inside the frame, and I especially love its reflective paint details and LED headlight built into the frame. </p><p>In terms of frame geometry, the Centauri II is designed to put riders in a slightly less upright position than many e-bikes. You&rsquo;re not bent in half like a road biker, but you&rsquo;re not bolt upright like the witch in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> either;&nbsp; it&rsquo;s a nice middle ground between the comfort of an upright posture and the control of more forward-leaning position, and it&rsquo;s my personal sweet spot. The Centauri II has three sized frames, so you should be able to find the right bike for you if you're between 4'9&rdquo; and 6'4&rdquo;.</p><h2 id="the-centauri-ii-is-really-fun-to-ride">The Centauri II is really fun to ride</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any pre-conceived notions of this e-bike before I took my first ride, but once I put it together&mdash;the assembly was easy and took about 20 minutes&mdash;and got it onto the mean streets of North Hollywood, the Centauri II made a statement: This bike is dedicated to providing a ride that&rsquo;s smooth with as little hassle as possible. It's just <em>really</em> fun to ride. When I started pedaling and turned on the assist, the whisper-quiet motor and auto shifting kicked in and adjusted to my pedaling power and cadence to help me reach and maintain a speed of 20 mph quickly and with little effort. It&rsquo;s a class 3 e-bike, so the pedal assist will take you to 28mph should you put in the work to go that fast. Overall, it was a blast to drive, and I felt nimble and fast without feeling out of control.</p><h2 id="four-small-details-about-the-centauri-ii-that-i-liked">Four small details about the Centauri II that I liked</h2><p>Here are some of the smaller details that I appreciated when riding the Centauri II e-bike:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Front suspension fork:</strong> The Centauri II comes with a &ldquo;mono shock&rdquo; above the front wheel. While not a mountain bike suspension fork, the mono shock provides 30mm of travel, enough to quiet urban-ride chatter like potholes and uneven pavement, but not enough for a technical single-track. While it&rsquo;s no mountain bike, I took the Centauri II off road for a few miles and found it performed well on a hard-packed fire road.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Weight</strong>: The Centauri II weighs around 50 pounds. That's light for an e-bike, but more importantly, the weight is distributed in a way that made the bike feel responsive and under control.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>The saddle</strong>: Bike seat comfort is a personal decision, but I found the Centauri II saddle wasn't overly padded or too big. It was a comfortable place to spend some time.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>A bell:</strong> There&rsquo;s a little analog &ldquo;ding ding&rdquo; bell included, and I found it great.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h2 id="the-centauri-ii-drive-train-and-pedal-assist">The Centauri II drive train and pedal assist</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Good front suspension and a comfy saddle are great details, but I was especially curious about the pedal assist and drive train. The Centauri II is powered by a mid-drive motor from Ananda, and at a continuous output of 350w, it&rsquo;s not the most powerful motor out there (top continuous output allowed for e-bikes in the US is 750w), but mid-drive means the juice flows directly to the pedals instead of a wheel, so it picks up speed quickly and smoothly with a more natural-feeling power transfer instead of the jerky torque of a motorbike. And like most e-bikes, the Centauri II has five levels of pedal assist, but unlike others, its first level is &ldquo;chill mode,&rdquo; a configuration that keeps the bike in its lowest gear and tops out the assist at 12 mph. This is useful for climbing hills and keeping a safe speed on mixed-use bike paths. It's not a huge innovation, but a small detail that set the ride apart.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Centauri II has a Gates CDX belt drive which, unlike a chain drive, doesn't need to be lubed or maintained, doesn't rust, is quiet, and basically lasts forever. Beyond the belt drive, the Centauri II features an automatic three-speed transmission that takes the whole &ldquo;what gear am I in?&rdquo; question out of your ride. I&rsquo;ve tested an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/smalo-lx2-ebike-review" target="_blank">auto-shifting bike with a chain drive </a>(that supposedly used AI for shifting), and I wasn&rsquo;t overly impressed, particularly when it came to hills, but the Centauri&rsquo;s drive was different. It uses a mechanical system that shifts up and down based on speed. The way its pedal assist interacted with the transmission gave the right amount of power to keep the pedals turning easily, even when riding uphill. While three gears probably wouldn&rsquo;t be enough for an analog bike, the Centauri II almost never left me feeling like I was in the wrong gear during my 150 miles of testing. To really test out a no-shifter ride, I took the Centauri II on a couple of mountain rides including a trip with 2,000-feet of climbing, and it had no trouble. Big hills take more pedaling, but unless the grade is Tour de France-level steep, they&rsquo;re totally doable.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="the-centauri-ii-doesnt-have-a-throttle">The Centauri II doesn't have a throttle</h2><p>I consider the Centauri&rsquo;s lack of throttle control as a &ldquo;con,&rdquo; as many people like the option of sitting back on an e-bike and letting the motor do all the work. That&rsquo;s not my vibe, so the lack of throttle doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but your mileage may vary.&nbsp;In place of a throttle, the Centauri II has a &ldquo;boost&rdquo; button designed so you can start up faster and get up steeper hills, and it provides about three seconds of maximum power before it cuts off. It works as intended, but I didn't use it much, and I found the boost a little sketchy on hills where I felt a bit of lag between when the boost stopped and when the pedal assist began. It was disconcerting, particularly on steeper grade hills, as it felt like I suddenly lost power.</p><h2 id="the-centauri-ii-battery-and-display">The Centauri II battery and display</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The trade off for the Centauri having such a light weight is having a more limited battery life. Its 490-watt hour battery is meant for a range of between 20 and 60 miles, which seems accurate based on my riding. During one ride, I started with a full battery and took it on a hill-heavy ride including a couple miles of dirt roads. I was tired on the way home, so I kept the pedal assist high. I traveled around 26 miles and the battery was almost tapped when I got home. In other words, it&rsquo;s not the longest-running bike, so if range is your top consideration, you could do better. The batteries are UL-2849 compliant and charge in about 5-7 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Centauri II display, it's functional, clutter free, and easy to read in bright sunlight. Each power level is a different color for each power level, so I could read it at a glance. The input are the standard &ldquo;on&rdquo; button, &ldquo;headlight on," and up and down arrows to control the PAS.</p><h2 id="overall-i-highly-recommend-the-centauri-ii">Overall, I highly recommend the Centauri II</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
