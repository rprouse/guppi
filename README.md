# GUPPI

GUPPI (or General Unit Primary Peripheral Interface) Is a semi-sentient software
being that helps Replicants interact with the many systems they have at their
disposal. This is an early implementation of the interface and as this is not
the year 2133 in the fictional [Bobverse](https://bobiverse.fandom.com/wiki/We_Are_Legion_(We_Are_Bob)_Wiki),
GUPPI is not actually semi-sentient and is only a command line utility to provide
me with the information I need.
